Business.\nOur Mission\nImprove people’s lives with \nthe world’s best transportation.Overview\nLyft,\n Inc  (the  “Company”  or  “Lyft”)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.  In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demandridesharing\n and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.\nWe\n believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal\n change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in selectcities\n in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing\n our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to i\nmprove the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We\n are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the“Lyft\n Platform”)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant\n number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit \nfrom technological innovation in mobility.Today,\n our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”)for\n shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fix\ned period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership.We\n generate substantially all of our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions fromdrivers\n for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue. We also generate revenue fromriders\n renting  Light  Vehicles,  drivers  renting  vehicles  through  Express  Drive,  Lyft  Rentals  renters,  Lyft  Driver  Center  and  Lyft  Auto  Care  users,  and  by  making  ourridesharing\n marketplace  available  to organizations  through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Corporate Business Travel programs.  In the secondquarter of 2021, we began genera\nting revenues from licensing and data access agreements, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies.We\n have  made  focused  and  substantial  investments  in  support  of  our  mission.  For  example,  to  continually  launch  new  innovations  on  our  platform,  we  haveinvested\n heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community,cultivate a diffe\nrentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerfulmultimodal platfor\nm and scaled user network.Notwithstanding\n the impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Wealso\n continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-drivingtechnology\n on the Lyft network. Our strategy is to always be at the forefront of transportation innovation, and we believe that through these investments, we will continueto be well positioned as a le\nader in TaaS. Even as we invest in the business, we also remain focused on finding ways to operate more efficiently.To advance our mission, we aim\n to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility.We\n believe  that  our  brand  represents  freedom  at  your  fingertips:  freedom  from  the  stresses  of  car  ownership  and  freedom  to  do  and  see  more.  Through  our  LyftUpinitiative,\n we’re working to make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code. We arealso\n proud to be leaders in the fight against climate change. We’ve made the commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles (“EVs”) on the Lyft network by the end of 2030.We believe many users a\nre loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility.Our\n values, brand and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business.

These  impacts  to  the  development  and  deployment  of  autonomous  vehicle-related  technology  may  adversely  affect  our  business,financial condition and \nresults of operations.•\nIn response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we have had to take certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs, furloughs and salaryreductions, which\n may have adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees. As the severity, magnitude and durationof\n the COVID-19 pandemic, the public health responses, and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic’simpact\n on our operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives, remainsuncertain\n and difficult to predict. As the pandemic continues, the recovery of the economy and our business have fluctuated and varied by geography. Further, theultimate\n impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our users, customers, employees, business, operations and financial performance depends on many factors that arenot\n within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to thepandemic\n (including restrictions on travel and transport and modified workplace activities); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response thereto onlocal\n or  regional  economies,  travel  and  economic  activity;  the  speed  and  efficacy  of  vaccine  distribution;  the  availability  of  government  funding  programs;evolving\n laws and regulations regarding COVID-19, including those related to disclosure, notification and pricing; general economic uncertainty in key marketsand financial market volatility;\n volatility in our stock price, global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; the duration of the pandemic; the extent ofany virus mutations or new stra\nins of COVID-19; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.•\nIn light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financialand operating results.\nOur business could be adversely affected by natural d\nisasters, public health crises, political crises, economic downturns or other unexpected events.A significant\n natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, mobile networks, theInternet\n or the operations of our third-party technology providers. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known forseismic\n activity and increasingly for fires. The impact of climate change may increase these risks. In addition, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,other\n epidemics, political  crises, such as terrorist  attacks, war and other political  or social instability and other geopolitical  developments, or other catastrophic  events,whether\n in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole. For example, we have offices and employees in Belarus andUkraine\n that are expected to be adversely affected by the current conflict in the region. The impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or ourthird-party\n providers’ abilities could result in decreased demand for our offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.A deterioration of general macroeconomi\nc conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and\n results of operations are also subject to global economic conditions, including any resulting effect on spending by us or riders. A deterioration ofgeneral\n macroeconomic  conditions,  including  slower  growth  or  recession,  inflation,  changes  to  fuel  and  other  energy  costs  or  vehicle  costs,  or  decreases  in  consumerspending\n power or confidence may harm our results of operations. Economic  weakness or uncertainty, and constrained consumer spending have in the past resulted in, andmay\n in the future result in, decreased revenues and earnings. Such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negativelyaffect\n our ability to make decisions about future investments. In addition, economic instability or uncertainty, and other events beyond our control, such as the COVID-19pandemic,\n have,  and  may  continue  to,  put  pressure  on  economic  conditions,  which  has  led  and  could  lead,  to  reduced  demand  for  services  on  our  platform  or  greateroperating\n expenses.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nOur expenses will likely increase in the future as we develop and launch new offerings and platform features, expand in existing and new markets and continue toinvest\n in  our  platform  and  customer  engagement,  or  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  These  efforts  may  be  more  costly  than  we  expect  and  may  not  result  inincreased\n revenue  or  growth  in  our  business.  For  example,  we  have  incurred  and  will  continue  to  incur  additional  costs  and  expenses  associated  with  the  passage  ofProposition 22 in California including provi\nding drivers in California with new earnings opportunities and protections, including contributions towards healthcare coverage,occupational\n accident insurance and minimum guaranteed earnings, and we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with theCOVID-19\n pandemic, including sales, marketing and costs relating to our efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we have expanded overtime\n to include  more  asset-intensive  offerings  such as our network of Light  Vehicles,  Flexdrive,  Lyft  Rentals and Lyft  Auto Care.  We are  also  expanding the  supportavailable\n to drivers at our Driver Hubs, our driver-centric service centers and community spaces, Driver Centers, our vehicle service centers, Mobile Services, Lyft AutoCare,\n and  through  our Express  Drive  vehicle  rental  program.  In addition,  we have  established  environmental  programs,  such  as our commitment  to 100% EVs  on ourplatform\n by the end of 2030. These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation,asset\n life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, ourinvestments\n may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition to the above, a determination in, or settlement of, anylegal proceeding that classifies a\n driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations (includingpotentially\n suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow ourbusiness,\n which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Additionally,\n stock-based  compensation  expense  related  to  restricted  stock  units  (“RSUs”)  and  other  equity  awards  may  continue  to  be  a  significant  expense  in  futureperiods,\n and as of December 31, 2021, we had $587.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, that will berecognized\n over  a  weighted-average  period  of  approximately  1.7  years.  Any  failure  to  increase  our  revenue  sufficiently  to  keep  pace  with  our  investments  and  otherexpenses\n could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks andchallenges as we encounter \nthem, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.As\n our business recovers from the effects of COVID-19 and we endeavor to return to pre-COVID financial performance, our revenue growth rates and results ofoperations\n will fluctuate due to a number of reasons, which may include long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, slowing demand for our offerings,increasing competit\nion, a decrease in the growth of our overall market or market saturation, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and resulting changes to our businessmodel\n and our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incursignificant losses in the \nfuture and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.We face intense competit\nion and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The\n market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of newservices\n and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greaterresources\n or other strategic advantages.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nOur transportation network is comprised of:•\nRidesharing Marketplace. Our  core offering since 2012 connects drivers with riders who need to get somewhere. The scale of our network enables us to predictdemand and\n proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for driversand offer\n convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in citiesacross the United States and in s\nelect cities in Canada.•\nExpress Drive. Our  flexible car rentals program for drivers who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our requirements.Through\n our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the LyftPlatform.\n•\nLyft Rentals. In  2019, we launched Lyft Rentals to offer an attractive option for users who have long-distance trips, such as a weekend away. This is a separateconsumer offering from Exp\nress Drive.•\nLight Vehicles. We  have a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for optionsthat\n are more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. These modes can also help supplement the first-mile andlast-mile of a multimodal trip \nwith public transit.•\nPublic  Transit. Available  in  select  cities,  our  Transit  offering  integrates  third-party  public  transit  data  into  the  Lyft  App  to  offer  users  a  robust  view  oftransportation\n options around them and allows them to see transit routes to their destinations at no cost. Providing real-time public transit information is anotherstep toward providing effec\ntive, equitable and sustainable transportation to our communities, and creating a more seamless and connected transportation network.•\nLyft Autonomous.

Our key growth strategies include our plans to:•\nIncrease Rider Use Cases. We  are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offerproducts to\n simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services anduniversity\n safe rides programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizationsto manage the transport\nation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.•\nGrow Active Riders. We  see opportunities to continue to recoup and grow our rider base amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. We may make incrementalinvestments in our\n brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We may also offer discounts for first-time ridersto\n try Lyft or provide incentives to existing riders to encourage increased ride frequency. We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace byattracting\n and retaining more drivers on our network to deliver the best possible service levels. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand ournetwork\n coverage  beyond  the  geographies  and  markets  we  currently  serve.  We  also  believe  we  are  a  beneficiary  of  demographic  shifts,  such  as  the  growingpercentage of the U.S. population \nthat is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.•\nGrow Our Share of Consumers’ Transportation Spend. Lyft’s  transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft networkspans\n rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit and vehicle services. By integrating the fragmented transportation ecosystem, we are well positioned to deliverthe best holistic exper\nience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity.•\nDeliver  Increasing  Value  to  Drivers. We  strive  to  provide  drivers  that  use  Lyft  with  the  best  possible  experience,  including  access  to  the  best  economicopportunities. For example, throu\ngh our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We’ve also been investing in ourDriver\n Centers,  Mobile  Services  and  related  partnerships  that  offer  drivers  affordable  and  convenient  vehicle  maintenance  services.  By  making  the  driverexperience better \nand better, we can retain and attract more drivers to Lyft’s network.•\nInvest in our Marketplace Technology. Our  investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers andriders.\n Our investments in mapping, routing, payments, in-app navigation, matching technologies and data science are key to making our network more efficientand seamless to use.\n•\nThoughtfully Pursue M&A and Strategic Partnerships. In November 2018, we acquired Bikeshar e Holdings LLC (“Motivate”), the largest bike sharing platform inthe\n United States at the time and in February 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, LLC (“Flexdrive”), one of our longstanding Express Drive partners. We will continueto\n selectively  consider  acquisitions  that  contribute  to the  growth of our  current  business,  help  us expand  into  adjacent  markets  or  add new capabilities  to ournetwork.\n We believe drivers and riders will continue to benefit from a broad partner ecosystem that builds on our existing loyalty and reward programs. We havealso\n built strong relationships with transportation suppliers, state and local governments, and technology solutions providers and we intend to continue to pursuepartnerships that contr\nibute to our growth.Competition\nThe\n market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of newservices and offerings.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nSome measures we take to promote the safety of riders and drivers on the platform include:•\nAnnual background checks. Every driver is required to pass a professionally administered background check before they drive and each year after that.•\nOngoing  criminal  monitoring.  Continuous  criminal  monitoring  allows  us  to  quickly  deactivate  drivers  with  disqualifying  criminal  convictions.  We  also  checkdriving records throughout the y\near to promptly identify and remove disqualified drivers from the platform as soon as a violation is detected.•\nMandatory safety education.  Drivers must complete a safety program developed with RAINN, the largest anti-sexual violence organization in North America.These\n programs  can  vary  by  state  and  cover  topics  such  as  how  to  create  a  safe  and  comfortable  ride,  appropriate  conversation  topics,  respecting  personalboundaries, and recognizing and \nreporting sexual assault and sexual misconduct.•\nEmergency help, supported by ADT. If  a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly connect with anADT security professional.\n•\nHidden contact information and ride history. The  Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride. While ridersand drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, incl\nuding real user phone numbers, are not revealed. Drivers are also not ableto see a rider’s drop-of\nf location, whether it’s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.•\nTwo-way ratings and mandatory feedback. At  the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider ordriver\n who submits  a rating  of four  stars or fewer  is prompted  to provide  more details.  Anyone who rates  a rider  or driver  three  stars  or fewer  will never  bematched with that individu\nal again through the app.In 2021,\n we published our Community Safety Report, which is available on our website and details the frequency of some of the most serious safety incidents thatare reported to us, which ar\ne statistically very rare. From 2017 to 2019, over 99% of trips occurred without any reported safety incident, which accounted for 0.0002% of alltrips\n in this period. However, while safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we recognize that behind every report is a real person and real experience, and ourgoal is to make each Lyft \nride as safe as we possibly can.Government Regulation\nWe\n are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such asTNCs,\n public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentialityobligations,\n product  liability,  defects,  recalls,  auto  maintenance  and  repairs,  personal  injury,  text  messaging,  subscription  services,  intellectual  property,  securities,consumer\n protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions,terms\n of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medicaltransportation,\n healthcare  fraud,  waste,  and  abuse,  environmental  health  and  safety,  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  background  checks,  public  health,  anti-corruption,  anti-bribery,\n political contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls anddelivery\n of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in manycases\n due  to  their  lack  of  specificity.  As  a  result,  their  application  in  practice  may  change  or  develop  over  time  through  judicial  decisions  or  as  new  guidance  orinterpretations ar\ne provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.The\n TNC industry has also come under increasing scrutiny from non-profit organizations, regulators, and legislators for its environmental impact, specificallyincreasing\n greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\ndoes not perceive ridesharing or our other offerings as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding public health or safety, affordability or forother\n reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms, the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, then the market for our offeringsmay\n not further develop, may develop more slowly than we expect or may not achieve the growth potential we expect. Additionally, from time to time we may re-evaluatethe\n markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certainmarkets as a result of su\nch evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If\n we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business, financial condition andresults of operations could be harmed.\nOur\n continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and toincrease\n utilization  of  our  platform  by  existing  drivers.  To  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers,  we  have,  among  other  things,  offered  sign-up  and  referral  bonuses  andprovided\n access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. If we do not continue to provide drivers withflexibility on our plat\nform, compelling opportunities to earn income and other incentive programs, such as volume-based discounts and performance-based bonuses, that arecomparable or\n superior to those of our competitors and other companies in the app-based work industry, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits orour\n requirements for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilizationof\n our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example,during\n the pandemic, we have periodically had a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets particularly where restrictions on social activitiesand\n visiting business venues were or have been eased. This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offerincreased\n incentives to improve supply, our revenue may be negatively impacted. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have beenable\n to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. Our competitors may attempt to compete for drivers on the basis of these earning opportunities, ordrivers\n may determine that such earning opportunities are not sufficient. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increaseour\n expenses.  Notwithstanding  the  passage  of  Proposition  22,  ongoing  litigation  seeking  to  reclassify  drivers  as  employees  is  pending  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  Thisincludes\n a  lawsuit  seeking  to  overturn  Proposition  22  in  California,  where  a  lower-court  judge  issued  an  order  on  August  20,  2021  finding  that  Proposition  22  isunenforceable (which order is now on appeal \nwith Proposition 22 remaining in effect during the appeal). If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we maybe\n required  to  classify  drivers  as  employees  rather  than  independent  contractors  in  those  jurisdictions.

In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience seasonality in both ridesharing and Light Vehicle rentals during the wintermonths,\n which may harm our ability to attract and retain riders during such periods. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased and may continue to affect utilizationof\n our platform by riders, including longer term. If we fail to continue to grow our rider base, retain existing riders or increase the overall utilization of our platform byexisting\n riders,  we may not be able to provide drivers with an adequate level  of ride requests, and our business, financial  condition and results  of operations  could beadversely\n affected. In addition, if we do not achieve sufficient utilization of our asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Rentals vehicles,our business, financial condi\ntion and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\n rely substantially on our wholly-owned subsidiary and deductibles to insure auto-related risks and on third-party insurance policies to insure and reinsure ouroperations-related\n risks. If our insurance or reinsurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet theirobligations, we may not be able to mit\nigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.From the\n time a driver becomes available to accept rides in the Lyft Driver App until the driver logs off and is no longer available to accept rides, we, through ourwholly-owned\n insurance  subsidiary  and  deductibles,  often  bear  substantial  financial  risk  with  respect  to  auto-related  incidents,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  andunderinsured\n motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certainlimits.\n To comply with certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related risks, we procure a number of third-party insurancepolicies\n which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions. In all U.S. states, our insurance subsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change from time to time, ofthe auto-related r\nisk from some third-party insurance providers. In connection with our reinsurance and deductible arrangements, we deposit funds into trust accounts with athird-party\n financial institution from which some third-party insurance providers are reimbursed for claims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as ofDecember\n 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. If we fail to comply with state insurance regulatory requirements or otherregulations\n governing  insurance  coverage,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  be  adversely  affected.  If  any  of  our  third-party  insuranceproviders\n or administrators who handle the claim on behalf of the third-party insurance providers become insolvent, they could be unable to pay any operations-relatedclaims that we make.\nWe\n also procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including employment practices liability, workers’ compensation, businessinterruptions,\n cybersecurity  and  data  breaches,  crime,  directors’  and  officers’  liability  and  general  business  liabilities,  including  product  liability.  For  certain  types  ofoperations-related\n risks or future risks related to our new and evolving offerings, such as a scaled network of autonomous vehicles, we may not be able to, or may choosenot\n to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolvingofferings, and\n we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our insurance or reinsuranceproviders\n becomes insolvent, it could be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. Certain losses may be excluded from insurance coverage including, butnot limited to losses caus\ned by intentional act, pollution, contamination, virus, bacteria, terrorism, war and civil unrest.The\n amount of one or more auto-related claims or operations-related claims has exceeded and could continue to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits,for\n which we have borne and could continue to bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured retentions or otherwisepaid\n by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many types of claims, coverages and for a variety of commercial risks andare\n likely to do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when ourpolicies\n are renewed or replaced to manage pricing pressure. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) cost per claim,premiums\n or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providersfail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not pr\novided, (v) the number of claims and average claim cost under our deductibles orself-insured retent\nions differs from historic averages or (vi) an insurance policy is cancelled or non-renewed.Our actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adv\nersely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We\n establish  insurance  reserves  for  claims  incurred  but  not  yet  paid  and  claims  incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  related  estimable  expenses,  and  weperiodically\n evaluate  and, as necessary,  adjust our actuarial  assumptions  and insurance  reserves  as our experience  develops or new information  is learned.  We employvarious\n predictive  modeling  and  actuarial  techniques  and  make  numerous  assumptions  based  on  limited  historical  experience  and  industry  statistics  to  estimate  ourinsurance\n reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective and speculative.While\n an independent actuary firm periodically reviews our reserves for appropriateness and provides claims reserve valuations, a number of external factors can affect theactual\n losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open, fluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatorydevelopments, judicial d\nevelopments and unexpected23\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the potential impact on the company's financial condition and results of operations if their actual losses exceed their insurance reserves?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the potential impact on the company's financial condition and results of operations if their actual losses exceed their insurance reserves?", "answer": "The potential impact on the company's financial condition and results of operations if their actual losses exceed their insurance reserves could be adverse, as it could result in the company having to bear the excess losses, which could lead to a decrease in their financial condition and results of operations"}

If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we maynot\n be able to timely onboard potential drivers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers. Further, if the background checks conducted by ourthird-party\n background check providers do not meet our expectations or the requirements under applicable laws and regulations, unqualified drivers may be permitted toprovide rides on our platfor\nm, and as a result, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.We are\n also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing drivers on our platform.

Any of the  foregoing  risks  couldadversely affect our bus\niness, financial condition and results of operations.Changes to our pricing could adversely affect our abil\nity to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.Demand\n for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven, incentives paid to drivers and the fees we charge drivers.Many factors,\n including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies includingincreased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect\n our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader rangeof\n offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. Thisincludes\n the use of pricing algorithms to set dynamic prices depending on the route, time of day and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we havemade\n pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, throughcompetition,\n regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge thedrivers\n on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. Furthermore,the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders\n on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to competeeffectively\n in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local lawsand\n regulations  regarding  pricing  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  otherwise  have  imposed  limits  on  prices  for  certain  services  and  certain  local  regulationsregarding\n minimum earnings standards for drivers have caused us to revise our pricing methodology in certain markets, including New York City and Seattle. We havetested\n or launched, and expect to in the future test or launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as subscription packages and driver or rider loyalty programs. Wehave also modified,\n and expect to in the future modify, existing pricing methodologies, such as our up-front pricing policy. Any of the foregoing actions may not ultimatelybe successful in attra\ncting and retaining qualified drivers and riders or may result in negative public perception and harm to our reputation.While\n we continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in legal and administrative proceedings, our arguments may ultimately beunsuccessful. A\n determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver utilizing a ridesharingplatform\n as  an  employee,  may  require  us  to  revise  our  pricing  methodologies  to  account  for  such  a  change  to  driver  classification.  The  passage  of  Proposition  22  inCalifornia has enabled us to provide additional earning opp\nortunities to drivers in California, including guaranteed earnings. The transition has, and will continue to, requireadditional\n costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to this new model, including changes to our pricing. We have also tested or launched, andmay in\n the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for drivers on our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retainingqualified\n drivers.  Moreover,  successful  litigation  to  overturn  Proposition  22, or  the  reclassification  of  drivers  on  our platform  as employees  could  reduce  the  availablesupply\n of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices andbalance\n supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we couldbe underpricing\n or overpricing our offerings. In addition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. As we continue tolaunch\n new  and  develop  existing  asset-intensive  offerings  such  as  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles,  Driver  Hubs,  Driver  Centers  and  Mobile  Services,  Lyft  Auto  Care,Express\n Drive program and Lyft Rentals, factors such as maintenance, debt service, depreciation, asset life, supply chain efficiency and asset replacement may affect ourpricing\n methodologies. In addition, we have established environmental programs, such as our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may alsoaffect our pricing.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\ncontinue to be adversely affected to the extent we cannot attract or retain qualified drivers as a result of such providers being unable to complete certain background checksbecause\n of  data  access  restrictions,  court  closures  or  other  government  shutdowns  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  or  to  the  extent  that  they  do  not  meet  theircontractual\n obligations,  our  expectations  or  the  requirements  of  applicable  law  or  regulations.  If  any  of  our  third-party  background  check  providers  terminates  itsrelationship\n with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to securesimilar\n terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we maynot\n be able to timely onboard potential drivers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers. Further, if the background checks conducted by ourthird-party\n background check providers do not meet our expectations or the requirements under applicable laws and regulations, unqualified drivers may be permitted toprovide rides on our platfor\nm, and as a result, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.We are\n also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing drivers on our platform. If we or drivers on ourplatform fail to co\nmply with applicable laws, rules and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Any\n negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to safety incidents or data security breaches orincidences,\n could adversely  affect  our reputation  and brand,  and could  potentially  lead to increased  regulatory  or litigation  exposure.  Any of the  foregoing  risks  couldadversely affect our bus\niness, financial condition and results of operations.Changes to our pricing could adversely affect our abil\nity to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.Demand\n for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven, incentives paid to drivers and the fees we charge drivers.Many factors,\n including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies includingincreased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect\n our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader rangeof\n offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. Thisincludes\n the use of pricing algorithms to set dynamic prices depending on the route, time of day and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we havemade\n pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, throughcompetition,\n regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge thedrivers\n on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. Furthermore,the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders\n on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to competeeffectively\n in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local lawsand\n regulations  regarding  pricing  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  otherwise  have  imposed  limits  on  prices  for  certain  services  and  certain  local  regulationsregarding\n minimum earnings standards for drivers have caused us to revise our pricing methodology in certain markets, including New York City and Seattle. We havetested\n or launched, and expect to in the future test or launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as subscription packages and driver or rider loyalty programs.

Use  and  distribution  of  open  sourcesoftware\n may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification orother\n contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others tocompromise our platfor\nm and offerings.Some\n open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of opensource software we use, or grant o\nther licenses to our intellectual property.

From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of opensource\n software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership ofwhat\n we believe to be open source software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our platform will beeffective. If we are held to\n have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or otherliability, or be required t\no seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our offerings on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform,to discontinue or delay\n the provision of our offerings if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available, in source code form, ourproprietary code, any of which \ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n presence  outside  the  United  States  and  any  future  international  expansion  strategy  will  subject  us  to  additional  costs  and  risks  and  our  plans  may  not  besuccessful.\nIn\n 2017, we launched our offerings in Canada and we may continue to expand our international offerings.

For example, in 2021, in New York City, a competing operator named Joco attempted to launch a bike share program in violation of Citi Bike’s exclusivity,arguing\n that New York City could not regulate Joco because Joco’s stations were in private garages. The City successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against Joco,with our support. However, Joco\n continues to operate in a limited manner and it is possible Lyft may need to further support the City in additional legal action against Joco.A\n negative  determination  in other legal  disputes regarding  bike and scooter  sharing, including  an adverse  determination  regarding  our existing  rights to operate,  couldadversely\n affect our competitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted fromoperating\n due to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. For example, the City of Miami suspendedrentals\n of  bikes  and  scooters  from  March  through  October  2020  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  and  again  suspended  rentals  of  scooters  from  December  2020through February 2021 an\nd for a brief period in November 2021 due to concerns with certain aspects of the program.

Even if we are ableto\n successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent service offering. In particular, there couldbe\n negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving anincreased\n number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and scooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidentson our platform or inciden\nts involving our competitors’ offerings.We design and\n contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of bikesand\n scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations.

For example, third parties havein\n the past asserted legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries related to the actions of a driver or rider who may have previously utilized our platform, butwas\n not at the time of such injury. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we sometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency,protection\n of our reputation and to prevent the uncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we faceincreasing\n public scrutiny. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any riders, drivers or third parties could result in negativepublicity\n and  harm  to  our  brand,  reputation,  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  Our  insurance  policies  and  programs  may  not  provide  sufficientcoverage\n to adequately mitigate the potential liability we face, especially where any one incident, or a group of incidents, could cause disproportionate harm, and we mayhave to pay high premiums or dedu\nctibles for our coverage and, for certain situations, we may not be able to secure coverage at all.As\n we expand our network of Light Vehicles, we are subject to an increasing number of claims, lawsuits, investigations  or other legal proceedings related toinjuries to, or deaths of, r\niders of our Light Vehicles, including potential indemnification claims. In some cases, we could be required to indemnify governmental entities forclaims arising out of issu\nes, including issues that may be outside of our control, such as the condition of the public right of way. Any such claims arising from the use of ourLight\n Vehicles, regardless of merit or outcome, could lead to negative publicity, harm to our reputation and brand, significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure ordecreased\n use of our Light Vehicles. Further, the bikes and scooters we design and contract to manufacture using third-party suppliers and manufacturers, including certainassets\n and components we design and have manufactured for us, have in the past contained and could in the future contain design or manufacturing product issues, whichcould\n also lead to injuries or death to riders. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all product issues, and failure to do so could harm ourreputation\n and brand or result in personal injury or products liability claims or regulatory proceedings. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations.Our\n bikes and scooters have experienced product issues from time to time, which has in the past resulted in, and, in the future may result in, product recalls andremoval\n from  service,  injuries, litigation,  enforcement  actions  and regulatory  proceedings, and could adversely  affect  our business, brand, financial  condition  andresults of operations.\nWe\n design, contract to design and manufacture, and directly and indirectly modify, maintain and repair, bikes and scooters for our network of Light Vehicles.Such\n bikes and scooters have in the past contained, and, in the future may contain, product issues related to their design, materials or construction, may be improperlymaintained\n or repaired or may be subject to vandalism. These product issues, improper maintenance or repair or vandalism have in the past unexpectedly interfered, andcould\n in the future unexpectedly interfere, with the intended operations of the bikes or scooters, and have resulted, and could in the future result, in other safety concerns,including\n alleged injuries to riders or third parties. Although we, our contract manufacturers, and our third-party service providers test our bikes and scooters before theyare deployed onto our network, the\nre can be no assurance we will be able to detect or prevent all product issues.Failure\n to detect, prevent, fix or timely report real or perceived product issues and vandalism, or to properly maintain or repair our bikes and scooters has resultedor\n may  result  in  a  variety  of  consequences  including  product  recalls  and  removal  from  service,  service  interruptions,  alleged  injuries,  litigation,  enforcement  actions,including fines or penalt\nies, regulatory proceedings, and negative publicity.

Any of the foregoing risks could also result in decreased usage of our network of Light Vehicles and adversely affect our business, brand,financial conditions and \nresults of operations.If we fail to effecti\nvely manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Since 2012\n and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we generally experienced rapid growth in our business, the number of users on our platform and our geographicreach, and we expect to cont\ninue to experience growth in the future following the recovery of the world economy from the pandemic. This growth placed, and may continueto\n place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Employee growth has occurred both at our San Francisco headquartersand in a number of our\n offices across the United States and internationally. The number of our full-time employees increased from 2,708 as of December 31, 2017, to 4,453as\n of December 31, 2021. However, from time to time, we have undertaken restructuring actions to better align our financial model and our business. For example, in thesecond\n quarter of 2020, we implemented a plan of termination to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic challenges resultingfrom\n the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, which plan involved the termination of approximately 17% of our employees. Steps we take to manage ourbusiness operations, includin\ng remote work policies for employees, and to align our operations with our strategies for future growth may adversely affect our reputation andbrand, our ability to rec\nruit, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel.Our ability to manage\n our growth and business operations effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business willrequire\n us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage employees.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nwill  scale  efficiently  with  our  business.  Our  inability  to  adequately  detect  or  prevent  fraudulent  transactions  could  harm  our  reputation  or  brand,  result  in  litigation  orregulatory action and l\nead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We\n have  also  incurred,  and  may  in  the  future  incur,  losses  from  fraud  and  other  misuse  of  our  platform  by  drivers  and  riders,  including  in  connection  withprograms\n we put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have experienced reduced revenue from actual and alleged unauthorized rides fulfilledand\n miles traveled in connection with our Concierge offering. If we are unable to adequately anticipate and address such misuse either through increased controls, platformsolutions or other means, our pa\nrtner relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If\n we fail to effectively match riders on our Shared and Shared Saver Rides offering and manage the related pricing methodologies, our business, financial conditionand results of operations could be adversely af\nfected.Shared and\n Shared Saver Rides enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to benefit from a discounted fare at the cost of possibly longer travel times.With\n a  Shared  or  Shared  Saver  Ride,  when  the  first  rider  requests  a  ride,  our  algorithms  use  the  first  rider’s  destination  and  attempt  to  match  them  with  other  riderstraveling along\n a similar route. If a match between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route.For\n Shared and Shared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to ridersand the\n level of rider demand. We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able tomatch additional riders along the given route, and s\nuch fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride. The fare charged to the riders is decoupled from thepayment made to the driver as we do\n not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match. Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted and charged to ourShared\n or Shared Saver Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that drivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared or Shared Saver Ridesriders, then our business, finan\ncial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we fail to effecti\nvely manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.With\n the adoption of our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn platform andservice fees\n from drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted fare, and the amount earned by a driverbased\n on the actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider, in each case, less any applicable driver bonuses or incentives andany pass-through amounts pai\nd to drivers and third parties. As we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip,we\n take on risks related to the driver’s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider isless\n than  the  amount  we  committed  to  pay  a  driver.  In  addition,  riders’  price  sensitivity  varies  by  geographic  location,  among  other  factors,  and  if  we  are  unable  toeffectively\n account  for  such  variability  in  our  up-front  prices,  our  ability  to  compete  effectively  in  these  locations  could  be  adversely  affected.

We donot\n have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurityattacks,\n terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Wehave\n experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors,including\n infrastructure  changes, human  or software  errors,  website  hosting  disruptions  and capacity  constraints.  In addition,  any changes  in AWS’ service  levels  mayadversely affect our \nability to meet the requirements of users. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeatedsystem\n failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peakusage\n times, as we expand and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and mayadversely affect th\ne usage of our offerings.Our commercial agreement with AWS will\n remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after January31,\n 2026, and only after complying with certain advance notice requirements. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or forfailure\n to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminatedor\n we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, newcloud\n infrastructure service providers. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, leadto\n a  significant  short  term  loss  of  revenue,  increase  our  costs  and  impair  our  ability  to  attract  new  users,  any  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financialcondition and results of oper\nations.On\n February 1, 2022 we entered into an addendum to our commercial agreement with AWS, pursuant to which we committed to spend an aggregate of at least$350 million\n between February 2022 and January 2026 on AWS services, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the four years. If we fail to meet the minimumpurchase commitment du\nring any year, we may be required to pay the difference, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We\n rely  on  third-party  and  affiliate  vehicle  rental  partners  for  our  Express  Drive  program  and  Lyft  Rentals  program,  as  well  as  third-party  vehicle  supply,  fleetmanagement\n and finance partners to support our Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals program, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such parties andother risks related to our Express Drive and Lyft Rentals program, our business, f\ninancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\n rely  on  third-party  and  affiliate  vehicle  rental  partners  as  well  as  third-party  vehicle  supply,  fleet  management  and  finance  partners  to  supply  vehicles  todrivers\n for our Express Drive program. If any of our third-party vehicle rental partners or third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners terminates itsrelationship\n with  us  or  refuses  to  renew  its  agreement  with  us  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  the  availability  of  vehicles  for  drivers  in  certain  markets  could  beadversely\n impacted, and we may need to find an alternate  provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable  time frame.Similarly,\n in the event that vehicle manufacturers issue recalls that affect the usage or the supply of vehicles or automotive parts is interrupted, including as a result ofpublic\n health  crises,  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  affecting  vehicles  in  these  partners’  fleets,  the  supply  of  vehicles  available  from  these  partners  could  becomeconstrained. For example, in September 2019, GM issued a recall\n affecting the 2018 Chevy Malibu, which affected a moderate portion of the fleet provided by Lyft’s rentalpartners.\n In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which affected their ability to meet the requirements of our Express Drive program. If we cannotfind\n alternate third-party vehicle rental providers on terms acceptable to us, or these partners’ fleets are impacted by events such as vehicle recalls, we may not be able tomeet\n the driver and consumer demand for rental vehicles, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers and consumers.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\n•harm to our reputation and brand.In\n addition to the harms listed above, a determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding that classifies a driver on a ridesharing platform as an employeemay require us\n to significantly alter our existing business model and/or operations (including suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costsand impact\n our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations and our a\nbility to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.We\n have  been  involved  in  numerous  legal  proceedings  related  to  driver  classification.  We  are  currently  involved  in  several  putative  class  actions,  severalrepresentative\n actions  brought,  for  example,  pursuant  to  California’s  Private  Attorney  General  Act,  several  multi-plaintiff  actions  and  thousands  of  individual  claims,including\n those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to our Terms of Service to arbitration, challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independentcontractors.\n We are also involved in administrative audits related to driver classification in California, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey. See thesection titled “Lega\nl Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.Claims by others that we infringed their proprietar\ny technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.Companies\n in the markets in which we operate are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual propertyrights.\n In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or otherwiseobtained.\n As  we  gain  an  increasingly  high  public  profile  and  the  number  of  competitors  in  our  market  increases  and  as  we  continue  to  develop  new  technologies  andintellectual\n property, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows based on the following: increase in public profile, increases in the number ofcompetitors in our mark\nets, our continued development of new technologies, new products and services, and new IP, as well as potential international expansion. From timeto time third parties may\n assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” foradditional\n information about these types of legal proceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of intellectual propertyinfringement and,\n in some instances, have initiated licensing discussions. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses, there can be no assurance that we will besuccessful\n in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and others may now and in the future havesignificantly larger and more mature patent\n portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding companies orother adverse\n patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.Many\n potential  litigants,  including  some  of  our  competitors  and  patent-holding  companies,  have  the  ability  to  dedicate  substantial  resources  to  assert  their  intellectualproperty\n rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distractour\n management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required inconnection\n with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantialdamages,\n royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us fromusing\n or distributing our intellectual property, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adverselyaffect our business, finan\ncial condition and results of operations.With\n respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights, which maynot\n be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-exclusive, and thereforeour\n competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third-party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all,we may\n be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology or other intellectual property, which could require significant time (during which we would be unableto\n continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of oper\nations.Failure to protect or enforce our intell\nectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n success is dependent in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as code, information, data, processes and other forms ofinformation,\n knowhow and technology), or intellectual property, and as we grow, we will continue to develop intellectual property that is important for our existing orfuture\n business. We  rely  on a combination  of patents,  copyrights,  trademarks,  service  marks,  trade  dress, trade  secret  laws and contractual  restrictions  to establish  andprotect\n our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and may vary by jurisdiction. Even if wedo\n detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming andexpensive and\n could divert management attention. While we take precautions designed to protect our intellectual property, it may still be possible for competitors and otherunauthorized\n third parties to copy our technology, reverse engineer our data and use our proprietary information to create or enhance competing solutions and services,which\n could adversely affect our position in our rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Some license provisions that protect against unauthorized use, copying,transfer and disclosure o\nf our technology may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and42\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat are the potential consequences of failure to protect or enforce the company's intellectual property rights?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What are the potential consequences of failure to protect or enforce the company's intellectual property rights?", "answer": "The potential consequences of failure to protect or enforce the company's intellectual property rights could include: failure to protect our business, financial condition and results of operations, competitors and other unauthorized third parties may copy our technology, reverse engineer our data and use our proprietary information to create or enhance competing solutions and services, which could adversely affect our position in our rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights, which could be time-consuming and expensive and divert management attention, and we may not be able to develop alternative, non-infringing technology or other intellectual property, which could require significant time, effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful"}

As such, we do not have identical or analogous intellectual property protection inall\n jurisdictions, which could risk freedom to operate in certain jurisdictions if we were to expand.

We  cannot  assure  you  that  these  agreements  will  be  effective  in  controlling  access  to,  and  use  and  distribution  of,  our  platform  and  proprietaryinformation.\n Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ourofferings.\n Competitors and other third parties may also attempt to reverse engineer our data which would compromise our trade secrets and other rights. We also enter intostrategic partnerships, joint\n development and other similar agreements with third parties where intellectual property arising from such partnerships may be jointly-owned ormay\n be transferred or licensed to the counterparty. Such arrangements may limit our ability to protect, maintain, enforce or commercialize such intellectual property rights,including\n requiring agreement with or payment to our joint development partners before protecting, maintaining, licensing or initiating enforcement of such intellectualproperty\n rights, and may allow such joint development partners to register, maintain, enforce or license such intellectual property rights in a manner that may affect thevalue of the jointly-owned in\ntellectual property or our ability to compete in the market.We\n may  be  required  to  spend  significant  resources  in  order  to  monitor  and  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights,  and  some  violations  may  be  difficult  orimpossible to detect. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights coul\nd be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in theimpairment\n or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuitsattacking the\n validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology against unauthorizedcopying or use,\n as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductionsof\n enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or harm our reputation or brand. In addition, we may berequired\n to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new offerings or platform features, which may not be on commercially reasonable termsor at all and could advers\nely affect our ability to compete.Our\n industry has also been subject to attempts to steal intellectual property, particularly regarding autonomous vehicle technology, including by foreign actors.We,\n along with others in our industry, have been the target of attempted thefts of our intellectual property and may be subject to such attempts in the future. Although wetake\n measures to protect our property, if we are unable to prevent the theft of our intellectual property or its exploitation, the value of our investments may be underminedand our business, financial cond\nition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.Changes in laws or regulations relatin\ng to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply withsuch\n laws  and  regulations  or  any  other  obligations  relating  to  privacy,  data  protection  or  the  protection  or  transfer  of  personal  data,  could  adversely  affect  ourbusiness.\nWe\n receive,  transmit  and  store  a  large  volume  of  personally  identifiable  information  and  other  data  relating  to  the  users  on  our  platform.  Numerous  local,municipal, state,\n federal and international laws and regulations address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of certaintypes\n of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault ofNon-Solicited\n Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, the U.S. Federal Health InsurancePortability\n and  Accountability  Act  of  1996,  or  HIPAA,  Section  5(c)  of  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  Act,  the  California  Consumer  Privacy  Act,  or  CCPA,  and  theCalifornia Privacy Rights Act,\n or CPRA, which becomes operative on January 1, 2023. These laws, rules and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continuallychange, through new legislation, \namendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, theCPRA\n will require new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information.The\n CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcementremain\n unclear. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies andincur additional compl\niance-related costs and expenses. Additionally, other states have considered or have enacted legislation similar to the CCPA and CPRA.

In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Flexdrive, whichis\n now  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Flexdrive  remained  responsible  for  its  obligations  under  a  Loan  and  Security  Agreement,  as  amended,  with  a  third-party  lender,  aMaster\n Vehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender and a Vehicle Procurement Agreement, as amended, with a third-party;\n and, following the acquisition, we continued to guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed under these agreements. See Note 10 \"Debt\" to ourconsolidated\n financial statements, for further information on these agreements and our outstanding debt obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we had $711.4 million ofindebtedness for borrowed money outs\ntanding.Our ability to make schedul\ned payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subjectto\n economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service ourdebt\n and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets,restructuring\n debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any existing or futureindebtedness\n will  depend  on  the  capital  markets  and  our  financial  condition  at  such  time.  We  may  not  be  able  to  engage  in  any  of  these  activities  or  engage  in  theseactivities\n on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants thatmay\n prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, couldresult in the accel\neration of our debt.In\n addition,  our  indebtedness,  combined  with  our  other  financial  obligations  and  contractual  commitments,  could  have  other  important  consequences.  Forexample, it could:\n•\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in governmentregulation;\n•\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;•\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;•\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes; and•\nmake an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.Further,\n as  of  January  1,  2022,  LIBOR  settings  for  all  non-U.S.  dollar  currencies  and  U.S.  dollar  one-week  and  two-month  LIBOR  settings  ceased  beingpublished,\n provided or representative. InterContinental Benchmark Exchange and the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority have confirmed that LIBOR settingsfor all\n remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will cease to be published, provided or representative after June 30, 2023. If new methods of calculating LIBOR are establishedor if other benchmark rates\n used to price indebtedness or investments are established, the terms of any existing or future indebtedness or investments, including the terms ofFlexdrive’s debt instrumen\nts, may be negatively impacted, resulting in increased interest expense or lower than expected interest income.In\n addition, under certain of our and our subsidiary’s existing debt instruments, we and Flexdrive are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenantsregarding our\n business and operations, including limitations on Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions.If\n we or Flexdrive, as applicable, do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, and do not obtain a waiver or consent from the lenders,then,\n subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involveadditional\n restrictive  covenants  relating  to  our  capital-raising  activities  and  other  financial  and  operational  matters,  which  may  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  obtainadditional capital\n to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay ourloans immediately, and \nmay limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.49\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the main risk associated with the company's debt obligations?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the main risk associated with the company's debt obligations", "answer": "The main risk associated with the company's debt obligations is the potential for default, which could result in the acceleration of debt repayment and limit the company's ability to obtain additional financing"}

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nlaws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. See the risk factor entitled “Challenges to contractor classification ofdrivers\n that  use  our  platform  may  have  adverse  business,  financial,  tax,  legal  and  other  consequences  to  our  business.”  Such  regulatory  scrutiny  or  action  may  createdifferent\n or  conflicting  obligations  from  one  jurisdiction  to  another,  and  may  have  a  negative  outcome  that  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operations,  financialcondition,\n and results of operations. Additionally, we have invested and from time to time we will continue to invest resources in an attempt to influence or challengelegislation\n and  other  regulatory  matters  pertinent  to  our  operations,  particularly  those  related  to  the  ridesharing  industry,  which  may  negatively  impact  the  legal  andadministrative\n proceedings  challenging  the  classification  of  drivers  on  our  platform  as  independent  contractors  if  we  are  unsuccessful  or  lead  to  additional  costs  andexpenses\n even if we are successful. These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial conditionand results of operations.\nOur industry is\n relatively nascent and is rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipalregulatory authorities across the United States an\nd Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing.For\n example, in December 2018, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings calculations and utilization ratesapplicable to our\n ridesharing platform, as well as certain other ridesharing platforms. Our legal challenge was unsuccessful and other cities are exploring similar legislation.The\n City  of  Seattle  adopted  the  Transportation  Network  Company  Driver  Minimum  Compensation  Ordinance  effective  January  1,  2021,  which  sets  minimum  driverearnings calculations for\n our rideshare platform as well as other rideshare platforms. The City of Portland is also exploring driver earnings legislation. Other jurisdictions inwhich\n we currently operate or may want to operate could follow suit. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operationsinternationally,\n particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on ormaterial limi\ntations to our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n success, or perceived success, and increased visibility has driven, and may continue to drive, some businesses that perceive our business model negatively toraise\n their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations have and may continue to take actionsand\n employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to changesuch legal and regulatory \nregimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of drivers and riders to utilize our platform.Any of the foregoing risks could har\nm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Challenges to contractor classificat\nion of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.We\n are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedingsat\n the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a driver is anindependent\n contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification ofindependent\n contractors  are  subject  to  changes  and  divergent  interpretations  by  various  authorities  which  can  create  uncertainty  and  unpredictability  for  us.  For  moreinformation\n regarding the litigation in which we have been involved, see the “Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note 9.

Although we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them, such matters could result in substantialcosts and a diversion of our man\nagement’s attention and resources.Sales\n of  substantial  amounts  of  our  Class  A  common  stock,  or  the  perception  that  such  sales  have  or  could  occur,  could  depress  the  market  price  of  our  Class  Acommon stock.\nThe\n market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market, and theperception\n that  these  sales  have  or  could  occur  may  also  depress  the  market  price  of  our  Class  A  common  stock,  including  if  there  is  short-selling  or  other  hedgingtransactions.\nWe have\n filed a registration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction ofapplicable\n exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be available for immediateresale in the United Stat\nes in the open market.Sales of our\n Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Thesesales could also cause the \ntrading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.Delaware\n law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxycontest difficult, thereby d\nepressing the market price of our Class A common stock.Our\n status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change incontrol\n by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which theperson\n became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate ofincorporation and amended \nand restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:•\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws require the approval of at least two-thirds of ourthen-outstanding voting power;\n•\nour dual class common stock structure, which provides our Co-Founders, individually or together, with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of mattersrequiring\n stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B commonstock;\n•\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;•\nour stockholders are only able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and are not able to take action by written consent for any matter;•\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;•\nvacancies on our board of directors are able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;•\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President or a majority ofour board of directors;\n•\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;52\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat are the changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles that could affect our business?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What are the changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles that could affect our business?", "answer": "I do not know"}

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonableunder\n the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, ourfuture financial st\natement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.We\n believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the mostcritical\n to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 of the notes to ourconsolidated financia\nl statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Revenue Recognition\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\nWe\n generate substantially all our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We recognize revenue from fees paid by drivers foruse\n of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Drivers enter into terms ofservice (“ToS”) with us in orde\nr to use our Lyft Driver App.58\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the revenue per active rider for the three months ended December 31, 2021?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the revenue per active rider for the three months ended December 31, 2021?", "answer": "51.79"}
{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nWe provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders. This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers tofind,\n receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a result, our singleperformance obligation in t\nhe transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders.We evaluate the presentation of revenue on\n a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to therider\n or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver to arider (the driver’s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their promise to pro\nvide a transportation service to theircustomer\n through  use  of  the  Lyft  Platform.  While  we  facilitate  setting  the  price  for  transportation  services,  the  drivers  and  riders  have  the  discretion  in  accepting  thetransaction\n price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportationservices. As a result\n, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider.We\n report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from therider.\n We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with drivers toprovide\n transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not control theprovision of transportation s\nervices by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.We\n consider  the  ToS and our customary  business  practices  in identifying  the contracts  under  ASC 606. As our customary  business  practice,  a contract  existsbetween\n the driver and us when the driver’s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related charges from riderson\n behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement todrivers; thus the driver\n’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.We earn\n service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the amountearned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charge\nd to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare arrangement, as we do notcontrol\n the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver’s actions which may not be fullymitigated. We earn\n a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, in instances where an up-frontquoted fare offered to \na rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.We\n recognize  revenue  upon  completion  of  a  ride  as  the  single  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  and  we  have  the  right  to  receive  payment  for  the  servicesrendered upon the complet\nion of the ride.We\n offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if wecannot reasonably estim\nate the fair value of goods or services received.In\n some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations to requestrides\n for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or a percentage of theride price depending on the \ncontract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.We\n recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable subscription p\neriod.We\n generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling our promise to provide rideshare data and access toFlexdrive\n vehicles and bear the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. We act as a principal in delivering the data and accesslicenses and\n present revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery and vehicle access, are determined by assigning therelative fair\n value to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratably over the quarter for access to fleet vehicles asour\n respective  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  upon  the  delivery  of  each.  Refer  to  Note  4  \"Divestitures\"  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  informationregarding the divestitu\nre of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)\nWe\n generate  rental  revenues  primarily  from  Flexdrive,  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles,  and  Lyft  Rentals.  Under  the  Flexdrive  and  Lyft  Rentals  programs,  weoperate\n a fleet of rental vehicles comprised of both vehicles owned by us and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. We either lease or sublease vehicles todrivers\n and Lyft Rentals renters, as a result, we are considered the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Forvehicles\n that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements. Driverswho rent vehicles are cha\nrged rental fees, which we collect from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the Lyft Platform.59\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the main service provided by Lyft to drivers and riders?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the main service provided by Lyft to drivers and riders", "answer": "We provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders.

When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries are uncertain, the recovery method should be used. The deferred gainliability would\n be amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining settlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlementperiod\n of the ceded reserves will be based on the life-to-date  cumulative  losses collected  and will likely extend over periods longer than a quarter.  The amount of thedeferral\n will  be  recalculated  each  period  based  on  loss  payments  and  updated  estimates.  Consequently,  cumulative  adverse  development  for  claims  ceded  under  theReinsurance\n Agreement in subsequent periods may result in significant losses to the statement of operations unless the deferred gain amortization recognized in the sameperiod\n to offset said losses. We believe that the net amount recognized on the statement of operations associated with claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement,including\n any related adverse development and any benefit recognized for the related deferred gains, should be excluded to show the ultimate economic benefit of theReinsurance\n Agreement. This adjustment will help investors understand the economic benefit of our Reinsurance Agreement on future trends in our operations, as theyimprove\n over  the  settlement  period  of  any  deferred  gains.  Additionally,  net  amounts  recognized  for  claims  ceded  under  the  Reinsurance  Agreement  would  representchanges\n to historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies. As stated above, we believe prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate thecurrent\n period performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is managed. This is because we have limited ability to influence the ultimate development ofthese historical claims, which can potentially date\n back years. Therefore, in the event that the net amount of any adverse developments and any benefits from deferred gainsrelated\n to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement is recognized on the statement of operations in a subsequent period, those amounts will be excluded from thecalculation\n of Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA through the exclusion of changes to liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historicalperiods.\n As of December 31, 2021, there have been no such net amounts related to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement which have impacted our consolidatedstatement of operations.\nWe\n had  restructuring  efforts  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  2020  to  reduce  operating  expenses  and  adjust  cash  flows  in  light  of  the  ongoing  economicchallenges\n resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business. We believe the costs associated with the restructuring do not reflect current periodperformance\n of  our  ongoing  operations.  We  believe  the  adjustment  to  exclude  the  costs  related  to  restructuring  from  Contribution  and  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  useful  toinvestors\n by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current period results and provide for better comparability with our historicallydisclosed Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA amounts.\nFor\n more information regarding the limitations of Contribution and Contribution Margin and a reconciliation of revenue to Contribution, see the section titled\"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measu\nres\".Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are key\n performance measures that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operatingleverage\n in our business.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nSignificant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims, fair value of financial instruments, goodwilland\n identifiable  intangible  assets,  leases,  indirect  tax  obligations,  legal  contingencies,  valuation  allowance  for  deferred  income  taxes,  and  the  valuation  of  stock-basedcompensation.\nBeginning\n in the middle of March 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) in the United States, Canada, and globally has impacted the Company’sbusiness.\n The Company continues to be impacted by COVID-19, but the long-term impact will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain andcannot\n be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, new information about additional variants, the availability and efficacy of vaccine distributions,additional\n or renewed actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or respond to its impact and altered consumer behavior, amongother\n things. The Company has adopted a number of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safetyrequirements\n for ridesharing and updating workplace policies. The Company also made adjustments to its expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenuesincluding\n headcount reductions in 2020. Refer to Note 17 “Restructuring” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the 2020 restructuring events. The\n Company  cannot  be  certain  that  these  actions  will  mitigate  the  negative  effects  of  the  pandemic  on  Lyft's  business.  As  of  the  date  of  issuance  of  the  financialstatements,\n the Company is not aware of any material event or circumstance that would require it to update its estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of theCompany's\n assets or liabilities, including the recording of any credit losses. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, andcould\n lead to impairment of long lived assets or goodwill, or credit losses associated with investments or other assets, and the impact of such changes on estimates will berecognized\n on  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  soon  as  they  become  known.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates  and  any  such  differences  may  bematerial to the Company'\ns financial statements.Segment Information\nOperating\n segments  are  defined  as  components  of  an  entity  for  which  separate  financial  information  is  available  and  that  is  regularly  reviewed  by  the  ChiefOperating\n Decision  Maker  (“CODM”)  in  deciding  how  to  allocate  resources  to  an  individual  segment  and  in  assessing  performance.  The  Company’s  Chief  ExecutiveOfficer\n is  the  Company’s  CODM.  The  CODM  reviews  financial  information  presented  on  a  consolidated  basis  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions,  allocatingresources,\n and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment. During the years ended December 31,2021,\n 2020 and 2019, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have materialassets located outside of \nthe United States.Revenue Recognition\nThe\n Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Lyft Platformand\n mobile-based applications.

The expected term of the ESPPpurchase\n rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period. Since the Company has limited history as apublic\n company and does not yet have sufficient trading history for the Company's common stock, the Company estimates volatility for stock options and ESPP purchaserights\n using the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly traded peer companies.

TheCompany recognizes compensat\nion expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The fair value of RSUs and PS\nUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which subsequent to the IPO isdetermined\n based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to the IPO, the Company granted RSUs which vestupon the satisfaction of both \na service condition and a performance condition.Compensation\n expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  theperformance\n condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.  The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of the  IPORegistration\n Statement on  March 28, 2019. On that date the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the acceleratedattribution method for \nthe RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relatedto these RSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service period\ns. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction ofa service-based condit\nion only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.Stock-based\n compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grantand revised, if necessar\ny, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.Income Taxes\nThe\n Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based onthe\n estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured usingthe enacted statutory tax rates that\n are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes the effect ondeferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Compa\nny records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets tothe net\n amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels ofincome, expectations and \nrisks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.Under the provisions\n of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law for all positions takenby\n the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may berecognized when it is more \nlikely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe\n technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expenseline in the accompanying \nconsolidated statement of operations.Business Combinations\nThe\n Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair valueof\n purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fairvalue\n of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired andliabilities\n assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nobligations of PVIC as reinsurer to Zurich for the Legacy Auto Liability, were assigned to, assumed by, and novated to Clarendon, for cash consideration of $465.0 million.As a result of the Novation, the Company\n’s obligations related to the Legacy Auto Liability were fully extinguished and novated to Clarendon on March 31, 2020.The\n Company  paid  the  $465.0  million  cash  consideration  to  Clarendon  on  April  3,  2020.  The  Company  derecognized  $407.9  million  of  insurance  reservesliabilities\n and recognized a loss of $64.7 million for the net cost of the Novation on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, with$62.5\n million in cost of revenue and $2.2 million in general and administrative expenses. In conjunction with the Novation, Clarendon and PVIC executed a RetrocessionAgreement, pursuant to which PVIC will re\ninsure Clarendon’s losses related to the Legacy Auto Liability in excess of an aggregate limit of $816.0 million.Reinsurance of Certain Legacy Auto Liabil\nity InsuranceOn\n April  22,  2021,  the  Company’s  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Pacific  Valley  Insurance  Company,  Inc.  (“PVIC”),  entered  into  a  Quota  Share  ReinsuranceAgreement\n (the “Reinsurance Agreement”) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (“DARAG”), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, basedon\n reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement,PVIC\n ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1,2020,\n with an aggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (“the Reinsurance Transaction”). The Reinsurance Agreement is on a funds withheldbasis,\n meaning  that  funds  are  withheld  by  PVIC  from  the  insurance  premium  owed  to  DARAG  in  order  to  pay  future  reinsurance  claims  on  DARAG’s  behalf.  Uponconsummation\n of the Reinsurance Transaction, a reinsurance recoverable of $251.3 million was established, and since a contractual right of offset exists, the reinsurancerecoverable\n has been netted against the funds withheld liability balance of $271.5 million for a $20.2 million net funds withheld liability balance included in accrued andother current liabilities on\n the consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the initial funds withheld balance of $271.5 million, additional coverage of certain legacy insuranceliabilities\n is collateralized by a trust account established by DARAG for the benefit of PVIC, which was $75.0 million upon consummation. As of December 31, 2021, thebalance\n of  the  net  funds  withheld  liability  is  zero.  A  loss  of  approximately  $20.4  million  for  the  total  cost  of  the  Reinsurance  Transaction  was  recognized  on  theconsolidated statemen\nt of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.The\n Reinsurance Transaction does not discharge PVIC of its obligations to the policyholder.

These  renewal  options  are  not  considered  in  the  remaining  lease  term  unless  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  theCompany\n will exercise such options. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or longer, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability representingthe\n fixed component of the lease payment. Any fixed payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance  or other services provided by thelandlord, are accounted \nfor as a component of the lease payment and therefore, a part of the total lease cost.Flexdrive Program\nThe\n Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive, a portion of which are leased from third-party vehicle leasing companies.

The putative class actions have been consolidated into two putative class actions, one in California state court and the other infederal\n court. The derivative actions have also been consolidated into one action in federal court in California. On July 1, 2020, the California state court sustained in partand\n overruled in part the Company's demurrer to the consolidated complaint. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on August 3, 2020. On February26,\n 2021, the California state court struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend, and plaintiffs filed an amendedcomplaint\n on March 17, 2021. The Company filed its demurrer and motion to strike the amended claim on April 13, 2021, and on July 16, 2021, the California state courtoverruled the demurrer\n but struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend. The state court plaintiffs filed their renewedmotion\n to certify a class action on June 24, 2021, and on January 25, 2022, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion without prejudice and stayed the case in light of the certifiedclass\n action proceeding in federal court. In the California federal court class action, on May 14, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaintand on September 8, 2020, the federal court granted in part an\nd denied in part that motion. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on October 2, 2020,and\n the court certified the class action on August 20, 2021, and set trial to commence on December 5, 2022.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)The Company\n recognizes revenue for its rideshare marketplace in accordance with ASC 606. The Company generates revenue from service fees and commissions(collectively, “fees”) paid by\n drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully complete rides via the LyftApp\n where  the  Company  operates  as  a  TNC.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  upon  completion  of  each  ride.  Drivers  enter  into  terms  of  service  (“ToS”)  with  theCompany\n in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platformand related\n activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver toprovide a\n transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the grossamount collected from the rider.\nAs\n the Company’s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver’s ability to cancel the ride lapses, whichtypically\n is upon pickup of the rider. The Company’s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of asuccessful\n transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied upon the completion ofthe\n ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism andretains its fees befo\nre making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.The\n Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable\n subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from auto maintenance and collision repair services in accordance withASC 606.\nThe\n Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide ridesharedata\n and  access  to  Flexdrive  vehicles  and  bears  the  fulfillment  risk,  and  the  responsibility  of  providing  the  data,  over  the  license  period.  The  Company  is  acting  as  aprincipal\n in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery andvehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligation\ns. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratablyover the quarter for a\nccess to fleet vehicles as the Company’s respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)\nThe\n Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Rental revenues are recognized for rental andrental related a\nctivities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842.The\n Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. TheCompany\n either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, asapplicable,\n in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs,as\n applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financialstatements. Drivers who rent v\nehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the LyftPlatform.\nDue\n to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenuegenerated\n from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals isrecognized evenly over th\ne rental period, which is typically seven days or less.Enterprise and Trade Receivables\nThe\n Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider’s authorized payment method. Uncollected fees areincluded\n in  prepaid  expenses  and  other  current  assets  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  represent  receivables  from  (i)  participants  in  the  Company’s  enterpriseprograms (“Enterprise Users”), where the transacti\nons have been completed and the amounts owed from the Enterprise Users have either been invoiced or are unbilled as ofthe reporting date; and (ii) riders where the authorized payment method is a credit card but the fare amounts have not yet settled wit\nh third-party payment processors. Underthe\n ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related chargesit\n collects from riders on behalf of drivers. Accordingly, the Company has no trade receivables from drivers. The portion of the fare receivable to be remitted to drivers isincluded in accrued and oth\ner current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.The\n Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected. As a result of the adoption ofAccounting\n Standards Update No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses\" (“ASC 326”), the Company’s measurement of the allowance for credit losses has beenaugmented to reflect the chan\nge from the incurred loss87\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the Company's accounting treatment for the allowance for credit losses?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the Company's accounting treatment for the allowance for credit losses?", "answer": "The Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nmodel to the expected credit loss model. The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company’s current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the enterprise andtrade\n receivables  balance.  In  determining  the  expected  credit  losses,  the  Company  considers  its  historical  loss  experience,  the  aging  of  its  receivable  balance,  currenteconomic and\n business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodicallyand as needed, and amounts are wr\nitten off when determined to be uncollectible.The\n Company’s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users, was $196.2 million, $104.7 million and $120.0 million as ofDecember\n 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company's allowance for credit losses was $9.3 million, $15.2 million and $6.2 million as of December 31, 2021,2020\n and 2019,  respectively.  The write-offs  were  immaterial  for  the  year  ended  December  31, 2021. The  change  in the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the  year  endedDecember\n 31, 2021 was related to $4.5 million of reductions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.4 million of write-offs. The change in the allowance for creditlosses for\n the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to $11.7 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $2.7 million of write-offs. The change inthe\n allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to $5.1 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.5 million ofwrite-offs.\nIncentive Programs\nThe\n Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive cashincentives\n while  riders,  Light  Vehicle  riders  and  Lyft  Rentals  renters  generally  receive  free  or  discounted  rides  under  such  incentive  programs.  Incentives  provided  todrivers,\n Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not theCompany’s customers, incentiv\nes provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.Driver Incentives\nThe\n Company  offers  various  incentive  programs  to  drivers,  including  minimum  guaranteed  payments,  volume-based  discounts  and  performance-based  bonuspayments.\n These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.  TheCompany\n reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the mostlikely\n outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Companydoes\n not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives forreferring\n new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or theestablished fair value of t\nhe benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.Rideshare Rider Incentives\nThe\n Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentiveprograms are as follows:\n(i)\nMarket-wide marketing promotions.  Market-wide  promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.This\n type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by thedriver\n to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction torevenue at the date i\nt records the corresponding revenue transaction.(ii)\nTargeted marketing promotions.  Targeted  marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders. An example isa\n promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a limited period of timeto\n a targeted group of riders. The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides aresimilar\n to  marketing  coupons.  These  incentives  differ  from  the  market-wide  marketing  promotions  because  they  do  not  reduce  the  overall  pricing  of  theservice\n provided  by  drivers  for  a  specific  market.  During  the  promotion  period,  riders  not  utilizing  an  incentive  would  be  charged  the  full  fare.  Theseincentives\n represent marketing costs. When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of theincentive is recorded \nas sales and marketing expense.(iii)\nRider  referral programs. Under  the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee) completestheir\n first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the correspondingcharge\n recorded  to  sales  and  marketing  expense.  Referral  coupons typically  expire  within  one  year.  The  Company  estimates  breakage  using its  historicalexperience. As of December 31, 2021 \nand 2020, the rider referral coupon liability was not material.88\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021", "answer": "The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021 was $9.3 million"}

The Company's allowance for credit losses was $9.3 million, $15.2 million and $6.2 million as of December 31, 2021,2020\n and 2019,  respectively.  The write-offs  were  immaterial  for  the  year  ended  December  31, 2021. The  change  in the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the  year  endedDecember\n 31, 2021 was related to $4.5 million of reductions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.4 million of write-offs. The change in the allowance for creditlosses for\n the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to $11.7 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $2.7 million of write-offs. The change inthe\n allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to $5.1 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.5 million ofwrite-offs.\nIncentive Programs\nThe\n Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive cashincentives\n while  riders,  Light  Vehicle  riders  and  Lyft  Rentals  renters  generally  receive  free  or  discounted  rides  under  such  incentive  programs.  Incentives  provided  todrivers,\n Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not theCompany’s customers, incentiv\nes provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.Driver Incentives\nThe\n Company  offers  various  incentive  programs  to  drivers,  including  minimum  guaranteed  payments,  volume-based  discounts  and  performance-based  bonuspayments.\n These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.  TheCompany\n reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the mostlikely\n outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Companydoes\n not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives forreferring\n new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or theestablished fair value of t\nhe benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.Rideshare Rider Incentives\nThe\n Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentiveprograms are as follows:\n(i)\nMarket-wide marketing promotions.  Market-wide  promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.This\n type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by thedriver\n to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction torevenue at the date i\nt records the corresponding revenue transaction.(ii)\nTargeted marketing promotions.  Targeted  marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders. An example isa\n promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a limited period of timeto\n a targeted group of riders. The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides aresimilar\n to  marketing  coupons.  These  incentives  differ  from  the  market-wide  marketing  promotions  because  they  do  not  reduce  the  overall  pricing  of  theservice\n provided  by  drivers  for  a  specific  market.  During  the  promotion  period,  riders  not  utilizing  an  incentive  would  be  charged  the  full  fare.  Theseincentives\n represent marketing costs. When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of theincentive is recorded \nas sales and marketing expense.(iii)\nRider  referral programs. Under  the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee) completestheir\n first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the correspondingcharge\n recorded  to  sales  and  marketing  expense.  Referral  coupons typically  expire  within  one  year.  The  Company  estimates  breakage  using its  historicalexperience. As of December 31, 2021 \nand 2020, the rider referral coupon liability was not material.88\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid to drivers under the driver incentives program?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid to drivers under the driver incentives program?", "answer": "I do not know"}

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nsince  the  last  adjustment  to  fair  value,  among  others.  If  an  impairment  exists,  the  Company  estimates  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  by  using  the  best  informationavailable,\n which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair valueof the investment on the conso\nlidated statements of operations.Concentrations of Credit Risk\nThe\n Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cashwith multiple financi\nal institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cashequivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordin\ngly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities toinvestment-grade securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe\n Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of anasset\n or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants woulduse\n in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurringor\n nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nsince  the  last  adjustment  to  fair  value,  among  others.  If  an  impairment  exists,  the  Company  estimates  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  by  using  the  best  informationavailable,\n which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair valueof the investment on the conso\nlidated statements of operations.Concentrations of Credit Risk\nThe\n Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cashwith multiple financi\nal institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cashequivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordin\ngly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities toinvestment-grade securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe\n Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of anasset\n or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants woulduse\n in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurringor\n nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fairvalue:\nLevel 1\nObservable inputs t hat reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2\nInputs  reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputsother\n than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data bycorrelation or other means.\nLevel\n 3Unobservable  inputs  reflecting  our  own  assumptions  incorporated  in  valuation  techniques  used  to  determine  fair  value.

The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that havebeen\n incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  estimable  administrative  run-out  expenses  related  to  the  processing  of  these  outstanding  claim  payments.  Liabilities  aredetermined\n on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information andapplication\n of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions.

Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in aprior\n year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.However,\n while the Company believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.

OnApril\n 20, 2021, the court granted the parties’ joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On May 3, 2021, the CaliforniaLabor\n Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber. The coordinationpetition\n was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On January 12, 2021, a separate lawsuit was filed in theCalifornia\n Supreme Court against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. The California Supreme Courtdenied\n review on February 3, 2021. Plaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 12, 2021. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services(PADS) -- the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that succes\nsfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 -- intervened in theAlameda\n lawsuit. On August 20, 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable.

Certain adverse outcomes of such actions would have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial conditionand\n results  of  operations,  including  damages,  penalties  and  potential  suspension  of  operations  in  impacted  jurisdictions,  including  California  or  Massachusetts.  TheCompany’s\n chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.

The  Company  believes  that  drivers  are  properly  classified  as  independent  contractors  and  plans  tovigorously\n contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain. The Company accrues liabilities that mayresult\n from assessments by, or any negotiated agreements with, these employment agencies when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, and the expense is recordedto general and administ\nrative expenses.Indirect Taxes\nThe\n Company is under audit by various domestic tax authorities with regard to indirect tax matters. The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily arises fromdisputes\n on  tax  treatment  and  tax  rates  applied  to  the  sale  of  the  Company’s  services  in  these  jurisdictions.  The  Company  accrues  indirect  taxes  that  may  result  fromexaminations\n by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general andadministrative expenses.\nPatent Litigation\nThe\n Company is currently involved in legal proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course ofbusiness,\n the Company receives correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property and/or assertinginfringement\n of such property. The Company disputes any allegation of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nsince  the  last  adjustment  to  fair  value,  among  others.  If  an  impairment  exists,  the  Company  estimates  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  by  using  the  best  informationavailable,\n which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair valueof the investment on the conso\nlidated statements of operations.Concentrations of Credit Risk\nThe\n Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cashwith multiple financi\nal institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cashequivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordin\ngly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities toinvestment-grade securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe\n Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of anasset\n or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants woulduse\n in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurringor\n nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fairvalue:\nLevel 1\nObservable inputs t hat reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2\nInputs  reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputsother\n than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data bycorrelation or other means.\nLevel\n 3Unobservable  inputs  reflecting  our  own  assumptions  incorporated  in  valuation  techniques  used  to  determine  fair  value.  These  assumptions  are  required  to  beconsistent with market \nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.The carrying\n values of the Company’s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time topayment.\nLight Vehicle Fleet\nThe\n Company’s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters. Scooters are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are included in prepaid expensesand\n other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the scooters, which isless than 12 months. As of December 3\n1, 2021, there were no scooters not yet placed in service. As of December 31, 2020, the cost of scooters not yet placed in service was$8.9\n million. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of scooters placed in service was $15.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of scooters placedin\n service was not material.

TheCompany\n elected the package of transition provisions available for expired or existing contracts, which allowed the Company to carryforward the historical assessments of(1) whether\n contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is orcontains\n a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified  asset and whether the lessee has the right to control such asset. TheCompany\n determines the classification and measurement of its leases upon lease commencement. The Company enters into certain agreements as a lessor and either leasesor\n subleases the underlying asset in the agreement to customers. The Company also enters into certain agreements as a lessee. If any of the following criteria are met, theCompany classifies the\n lease as a financing lease (as a lessee) or as a direct financing or sales-type lease (both as a lessor):•\nThe lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;•\nThe lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;•\nThe lease term is for 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, unless the commencement date falls within the last 25% of the economiclife of the underlying ass\net;•\nThe present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying asset; or•\nThe underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.92\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the Company's approach to determining whether an arrangement is or contains a lease?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the Company's approach to determining whether an arrangement is or contains a lease?", "answer": "The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether the lessee has the right to control such asset"}

For the yea\nr ended December 31, 2019, capitalized software development costs was not material.Insurance Reserves\nThe\n Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, toinsure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underi\nnsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protectionunder\n state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that havebeen\n incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  estimable  administrative  run-out  expenses  related  to  the  processing  of  these  outstanding  claim  payments.  Liabilities  aredetermined\n on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information andapplication\n of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate t\nhe liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.Insurance\n claims  may  take  years  to  completely  settle,  and the  Company has limited  historical  loss  experience.  Because  of the  limited  operational  history,  theCompany\n makes  certain  assumptions  based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significantassumptions, and utilizes actuarial\n models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time theclaim\n remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in aprior\n year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.However,\n while the Company believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As aresult,\n the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for onthe\n consolidated balance sheets. The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additionalclaims are report\ned and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.Net Loss Per Share\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net\n loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities.The\n two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulatedand\n participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between commonstock\n and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company’s redeemableconvertible\n preferred  stock  contractually  entitles  the  holders  of  such  shares  to  participate  in  dividends  but  does  not  contractually  require  the  holders  of  such  shares  toparticipate in the Comp\nany’s losses. There were no redeemable convertible preferred shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.Basic net loss per share is co\nmputed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less sharessubject\n to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which theCompany reports\n net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to commonstockholders, because potent\nially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.94\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the carrying value of the assets that are not recoverable?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the carrying value of the assets that are not recoverable", "answer": "I do not know"}

For purposes of this MutualArbitrat\nion Agreement (the \"Arbitration Agreement\"), references to Lyft shall include Lyft, Inc., and/or any entity affiliated with or related to Lyft,Inc.\n (including their owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, and allsuccessors\n and assigns of any of them). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after the Agreementterminates\n or my relationship with Lyft ends. Any  arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individual basis; classarbitrations\n and class actions are not permitted. Lyft and I further expressly waive the right to a jury trial, and Lyft and I agree that thearbitrator's award will be final and bi\nnding on both parties.This Arbitrat\nion Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. The types of disputes and claims covered by this Arbitration Agreement (referredto\n below as \"Claims\") include,  but are not limited to disputes over rights provided by federal, state, or local statutes, regulations, ordinances, andcommon\n law;  claims  related  to  salary,  overtime,  bonuses,  vacation,  paid  time  off,  wages,  meal  and  rest  breaks,  and  any  other  form  ofcompensation;\n claims  for  breach  of  contract,  wrongful  discharge,  fraud,  defamation,  emotional distress,  retaliation  and  breach  of  the  impliedcovenant\n of good faith and fair dealing; and claims involving laws that prohibit discrimination  and unlawful harassment based on any protectedclassification,\n including claims under Title Vll of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination inEmployment\n Act,  the  Older  Workers  Benefit  Protection  Act,  and  any  state  employment  statutes,  such  as  the  California  Fair  Employment  &Housing Act, and the California Labor Code.\n2.\nDisputes Excluded From Arbitration This\n Arbitration  Agreement  does  not  cover  claims  for  disability  and  medical  benefits  under  workers'  compensation  laws  or  claims  forunemployment\n benefits. Likewise, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prohibits me from filing an administrative charge with the federal EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission,\nU.S.\n Department  of  Labor,  Securities  Exchange  Commission,  National  Labor  Relations  Board,  the  Office  of  Federal  Contract  CompliancePrograms,\n the California Department of  Fair Employment & Housing, or any other similar local, state, or federal agency, or from participating inany\n administrative agency investigation. Notwithstanding this Arbitration Provision, either Lyft or I may seek to obtain injunctive relief in court toavoid irreparable harm that might take place prior to the resolution of any arbi\ntration.3.\nClass Action/Collective Action Waiver Lyft and I agree to bring any Claims in arbitrat\nion on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis. Accordingly, neither Inor Lyft shall bring, nor shall t\nhe arbitrator preside over, any form  of class or collective proceeding. In addition, unless all parties agree inwriting\n otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of more than one employee. Neither  I nor Lyft may seek, normay the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or \nthat affects other employees.Notwithstanding\n any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this sectionmay\n be  resolved  only  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  and  not  by  an  arbitrator. If a  court  decides  that  applicable  law  does  not  permit  theenforcement\n of any of this section's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from thearbitration and may be brought \nin court.4.\nRepresentative PAGA Waiver To\n the  fullest  extent  permitted  by  law,  Lyft  and  I  (1) agree  not  to  bring  a  representative  action  on  behalf  of  others  under  the  PrivateAttorneys General Act of 2004 (\"PAGA\"), \nCalifornia Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the purpose of the Mutual Arbitration Agreement?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the purpose of the Mutual Arbitration Agreement", "answer": "The purpose of the Mutual Arbitration Agreement is to require any and all claims, disputes, or controversies between Lyft and the employee to be resolved by final and binding arbitration, except for those excluded claims, such as those related to workers' compensation or unemployment benefits"}

Besides waiving rights and releasing claims encompassed by the General Release in Section 7(a) above, Employee promises not to bring a lawsuit or arbitration against the Company alleging any claim or violation of rights covered by that General Release. This\nCovenant Not to Sue is different from the General Release in that it is an affirmative promise by Employee, violation of which can result in a claim\nfor damages by the Company against Employee. Details regarding exceptions to this covenant and damages Employee must pay for violating it are\ncontained in Sections 7(d) and 18 below.\n(c) \nWaiver of Unknown Claims.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Employee is not waiving, releasing or giving up any claim for workers’ compensation benefits or unemployment benefits to which the Employee has an unwaivable right, vested pension or savings plan\nbenefits, claims to enforce this Agreement, claims under sections 2800 to 2810 of the California Labor Code, and claims under other state statutes\nthat may not be waived as a matter of law in an agreement of this type. Employee acknowledges, however, that Employee has no work-related injury\nor illness at the time of signing this Agreement for which Employee has not already filed a workers compensation claim.

If Employee is awarded money damages as described in the previous sentence, Employee shall decline to\naccept any such monetary award.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nto any person, firm, organization or entity, including but not limited to any current or former employees of the Company. Except as provided in thisparagraph, Employee shall not: (a) communicate or disclose in any way the amount of the Severance Pay or benefits made by the Company; or\n(b) give any indication of the amount of the Severance Pay. \nEmployee may communicate the terms and conditions of this Agreement (1) to Employee’s spouse/domestic partner; or (2) to Employee’s attorney and those rendering financial or legal advice and having a bona fide need to\nknow such terms and conditions; provided, however, Employee shall advise any such individuals beforehand of the existence of Employee’s\nconfidentiality obligations under this Agreement and their corresponding obligations to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement. A breach of\nthese obligations by Employee’s spouse/domestic partner, attorney, advisor, or agents will be deemed a breach of this Agreement by Employee.\nMoreover, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Employee from disclosing the terms and conditions of this Agreement to government agencies\nfor tax purposes (i.e., the IRS and Franchise Tax Board); or if required by a valid court order, subpoena, or regulatory request or other compulsory\nprocess or law; provided, however, that Employee shall advise such agency or court of the confidential nature of this Agreement and shall exercise\nreasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the subject matter disclosed. Further, the Company\nagrees that it will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to not publicly disclose any potential employment opportunity Employee may have\nprior to Employee or Employee’s new employer/company announcing it, with the exception of required disclosures to the Company’s Board of\nDirectors or advisors, or required by law, under applicable confidentiality obligations.\n(c) \nBreach of Confidentiality Provisions/Liquidated Damages. Employee agrees that if Employee, Employee’s attorney, or Employee’saccountant, financial advisor or spouse/domestic partner breaches the promise to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the Severance\nPay, then the resulting damage to the Company would be impracticable or extremely difficult to determine because of the uncertain effect of the\ndisclosure of such information on the Company’s present and future business prospects. Because of the difficulty of determining the damages\nresulting from any such breach of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, the parties agree that in the event of such a breach by Employee\neither directly by Employee or indirectly through Employee’s spouse, attorney or agents, Employee shall be obligated to re-pay to the Company the\nsum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) as liquidated damages for each occurrence, which amount Employee agrees is reasonable. Nothing herein shall\nlimit or restrict any other remedies available to the Company, at law or in equity, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by Employee of any\nobligations under this Agreement.    \n13.\nCooperation .  Following the Separation Date, Employee also agrees to cooperate with the Company in regard to the transition of thebusiness matters handled by Employee on behalf of the Company. Employee agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Company and its counsel in the\ndefense or prosecution of any claims or actions now in existence or which may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company, or in\nany investigation or review that may be performed by the Company or any governmental authority, which relate in any way to events or occurrences\nthat transpired while Employee was employed by the Company or about which Employee may have knowledge. Employee’s cooperation in\nconnection with such claims, actions, or investigations will include, but not be limited to, being available to meet with the Company’s counsel to\nprepare for discovery or any legal proceeding, executing documents, and providing truthful testimony as a witness on behalf of the Company at\nmutually convenient times. The Company will reimburse Employee for all reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket costs and expenses (but not\nincluding attorneys’ fees) that Employee incurs in connection with obligations under this paragraph.\n14.\nNon-Disparagement .
