We  connect  consumers  (“Rider(s)”)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (“Mobility  Driver(s)”)  forridesharing  services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (“Eater(s)”)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  “Merchants”)  with  deliveryservice  providers  (“Couriers”)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.  Riders  and  Eaters  are  collectively  referred  to  as  “end-user(s)”  or“consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We usethis same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).Our SegmentsAs of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fragmented markets.MobilityMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe  world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category position in its respective market.DeliveryOur  Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.During 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (“Cornershop”) in an all-stock transaction. Theacquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The DrizlyGroup, Inc.  (“Drizly”),  allowing  us to expand alcohol  offerings  in our Delivery  business  with Drizly’s  leading  platform,  technology,  scale,  and expertise.  Theacquisition of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination. For additional information, see Note 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.FreightWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizingindustries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industryis highly fragmented  and deeply inefficient.  It can take several  hours, sometimes  days, for shippers to find a truck and driver  for shipments,  with most of theprocess conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It isequally  difficult  for  carriers  to  find  and  book  the  shipments  that  work  for  their  businesses,  spending  hours  on  the  phone  negotiating  pricing  and  terms.

As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additionalcompetition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:•Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the marketsthat we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.•Delivery.  Our  Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in  the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in  various  regions  for  drivers,consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. OurDelivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.•Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics,Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.Government RegulationWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,and  regulations,  including  those  related  to  Internet  activities,  privacy,  cybersecurity,  data  protection,  intellectual  property,  competition,  consumer  protection,payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations areconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations weare subject to are described below.MobilityOur  platform,  and  in  particular  our  Mobility  products,  are  subject  to  differing,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  the  numerousjurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  A  large  number  of  proposals  are  before  various  national,  regional,  and  local  legislative  bodies  and  regulatory  entities,  bothwithin the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,and  regulations  while  other  jurisdictions  have  not  adopted  any  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  which  govern  our  Mobility  business.  Further,  certain  jurisdictions,including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, andregulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment createssignificant complexities for our business and operating model.Substantially  all  states  in the  United  States and numerous  municipalities  in the  United  States  and around  the  world have adopted  Transportation  NetworkCompany (“TNC”) regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their ownvehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California’s AssemblyBill  5  (“AB5”),  which  went  into  effect  in  January  2020,  codified  a  test  to  determine  whether  a  worker  is  an  employee  under  California  law.  The  CaliforniaAttorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,  and sought  an injunction  and  monetary  damages  related  to  the  alleged  competitive  advantage  caused  by  the  alleged  misclassification  of  drivers.Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California stateballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and weexpect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to complywith the provisions of Proposition 22.

As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services onour  platform  that  went  into  effect  on  January  1,  2021,  and  other  jurisdictions  have  in  the  past  considered  or  may  consider  regulations  which  wouldimplement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislativeor regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.See the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significantcomplexities for our business and operating model.As we continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.Data Privacy and ProtectionOur  technology  platform,  and  the  user  data  we  collect  and  process  to  run  our  business,  are  an  integral  part  of  our  business  model  and,  as  a  result,  ourcompliance  with  laws  dealing  with  the  collection  and  processing  of  personal  data  is  core  to  our  strategy  to  improve  platform  user  experience  and  build  trust.Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing ofpersonally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Twoexamples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), a lawwhich went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the CaliforniaConsumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirementsfor  covered  businesses.  U.S.  state,  city,  and  foreign  regulators  are  expected  to  continue  proposing  and  adopting  significant  laws  impacting  the  processing  ofpersonally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November2020 (effective in January 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.Payments and Financial ServicesMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, UberPayments  B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  as  an  electronic  money  institution  in  support  of  certain  payment  activities  in  the  European  Economic  Area  (the“EEA”). Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtainlicenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such lawscould affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals inseveral other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.AntitrustCompetition  authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as7 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the name of the city where Uber suspended its Mobility products in January 2019 due to regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the name of the city where Uber suspended its Mobility products in January 2019 due to regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers", "answer": "Barcelona"}

We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of theCOVID-19  pandemic  and  related  restrictions,  which  altered  typical  travel  patterns.  We  expect  that  seasonality  will  eventually  return  to  its  historic  patterns  asrecovery from the pandemic continues.DeliveryWe typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although thehistorical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations.

Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced newdynamics into the households of many of our employees.

We have resolved the classification claims of a majority ofthese Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, we areinvolved  in  numerous  legal  proceedings  regarding  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements  entered  into  with  Drivers.  If  we  are  not  successful  in  suchproceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on ourbusiness and financial condition.Changes  to  foreign,  state,  and  local  laws  governing  the  definition  or  classification  of  independent  contractors,  or  judicial  decisions  regarding  independentcontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. InAugust 2020, the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe  pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court’s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the injunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours for independent  work. Proposition 22 went into  effect  in December  2020 and we expect  that Drivers  will  be able  to maintain  their  status as independentcontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,  we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not haveadequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another  example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.  Uber  B.V.,  et  al.  ruling  by  theEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan  self-employed).  Subsequent  to the  UK Supreme  Court’s  ruling,  we announced  that  we will  treat  all  UK drivers  as “workers”  under  UK labor  law, goingforward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme  Court  that  reclassified  an  UberX  Driver  as  an  employee  (which  has  been  followed  by  inconsistent  appellate  decisions  regarding  employee  status),decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In  addition,  reclassification  of  Drivers  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist,  have  and  could  lead  to  groups  of  Driversbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number ofDrivers  were  to  become  unionized  and  collective  bargaining  agreement  terms  were  to  deviate  significantly  from  our  business  model,  our  business,  financialcondition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disruptour operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentationincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “CriticalAccounting  Estimates”  included  in  Part  II,  Item  7  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  and  Note  1  in  the  section  titled  “Notes  to  the  Consolidated  FinancialStatements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report14 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the total amount of money paid by the company to settle classification claims with drivers?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the total amount of money paid by the company to settle classification claims with drivers", "answer": "approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021"}

If we are unable to compete effectively in theseindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity toshift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and othermerchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume oforders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan  we  do.  As  we  and  our  competitors  introduce  new  products  and  offerings,  and  as  existing  products  evolve,  we  expect  to  become  subject  to  additionalcompetition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate  our products. Increased competitioncould result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of ourplatform, and our margins.We face competition in each of our offerings, including:•Mobility.  Our  Mobility  offering  competes  with  personal  vehicle  ownership  and  usage,  which  accounts  for  the  majority  of  passenger  miles  in  themarkets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. Inaddition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option inmany cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, includingLyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.•Delivery.  Our Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in various  regions  for  Drivers,consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.Our  Delivery  offering  also  competes  with  restaurants,  including  those  that  offer  their  own  delivery  and/or  take-away,  meal  kit  delivery  services,grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.•Freight. Our  Freight  offering  competes  with  global  and  North  American  freight  brokers  such  as  C.H.  Robinson,  Total  Quality  Logistics,  XPOLogistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.Many of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer discounted services, Driver incentives, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative products andofferings, and alternative pricing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than those that we offer. Further, some of our current or potential competitorshave, and may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier bases in a particular geographicmarket. In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operatinghistories, larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respondmore quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which mayrender our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may share in the effective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals andlitigation victories we may achieve, without having to incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.We are contractually restricted from competing with our minority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including in China throughAugust 2023, Russia/CIS through February 2025, Southeast Asia through the later of March 2023 or one year after we dispose of all interests in Grab, India withrespect to meal delivery through January 2023, and the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and certain parts of Europe with respect to e-bikes and e-scooters through May 2023, while none of our minority-owned affiliates are restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world.

Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all orpart of our or the target company’s operations or agree to other remedies. Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our inability to compete effectively wouldhave an adverse effect on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, andmay  continue  to  offer,  significant  Driver  incentives  and  consumer  discounts  and  promotions,  which  has  adversely  affected  and  may  continue  to  adverselyaffect our financial performance.To remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or servicefees, and we have offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets,we have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives aDriver receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets andregions, we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discountsand promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts andpromotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and willcontinue to negatively affect, our financial performance. Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have beenmodified over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricingmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see inthe application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to successfully manage these andsimilar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adversely impacted.The markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitorswill  continue  to  be  highly  capitalized.

These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed inincreasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses.

Although we maybenefit from having larger network scale and liquidity than some competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcomeby smaller competitors. Maintaining a balance between supply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may bemore  important  to  service  quality  than  the  absolute  size  of  the  network.  If  our  service  quality  diminishes  or  our  competitors’  products  achieve  greater  marketadoption, our competitors may be able to grow at a quicker rate than we do and may diminish our network effect.Our number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operationof our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Driversand merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand,including  as  a  result  of  safety  incidents  and  corporate  reporting  related  to  safety,  perceived  political  or  geopolitical  affiliations,  a  pandemic  or  an  outbreak  ofdisease or similar public health concern, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has notfundamentally  changed,  dissatisfaction  with  changes  we  make  to  our  products  and  offerings,  or  dissatisfaction  with  our  products  and  offerings  in  general.  Inaddition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptablemanner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers do not establish ormaintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-qualitysupport, or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, our revenue would decline, and ourbusiness would suffer.The number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide theirservices through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms orservices, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or otheraspects of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similarwork, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives toimprove our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.Often, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likelybe viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and securitybreaches,  including  terminating  access  to  our  platform  for  users  with  low  ratings  or  reported  incidents,  and  imposing  certain  qualifications  for  Drivers  andmerchants,  which  may  damage  our  relationships  with  platform  users  or  discourage  or  diminish  their  use  of  our  platform.  Further,  we  are  investing  in  ourautonomous  vehicle  strategy,  which  may  add  to  Driver  dissatisfaction  over  time,  as  it  may  reduce  the  need  for  Drivers.  Driver  dissatisfaction  has  in  the  pastresulted in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protestsmay result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce ournetwork liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage.17 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the main concern for the company's operating results in the near term?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the main concern for the company's operating results in the near term", "answer": "Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the near term"}

Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these effortsmay not be successful. Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated ormanaged to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions. Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, suchreorganizations may not be successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our company.Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020.

Suchactions  may  result  in  injuries,  property  damage,  or  loss  of  life  for  consumers  and  third  parties,  or  business  interruption,  brand  and  reputational  damage,  orsignificant liabilities for us. Although we administer certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers throughthird-party service providers, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in certainjurisdictions  according  to  national  and  local  laws,  and  our  third-party  service  providers  may  fail  to  conduct  such  background  checks  adequately  or  discloseinformation  that  could  be  relevant  to  a  determination  of  eligibility.  Further,  the  qualification  and  background  check  standards  for  Couriers  are  generally  lessextensive than those conducted for Mobility Drivers. In addition, we do not independently test Drivers’ driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue toreceive complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have also faced civillitigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety ofour platform.If Drivers or carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform asa conduit for criminal activity, consumers and shippers may not consider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result ofour business relationship with such Driver or carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents andallegations worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwiseengaging in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct whileusing  our  platform,  Drivers  and  merchants  may  be  unwilling  to  continue  using  our  platform.  In  addition,  certain  regions  where  we  operate  have  high  rates  ofviolent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports ofDrivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. Ifother criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may beharmed, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Public reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.Further,  we  may  be  subject  to  claims  of  significant  liability  based  on  traffic  accidents,  deaths,  injuries,  or  other  incidents  that  are  caused  by  Drivers,consumers, or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, wemay face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. Inaddition, the growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable roadusers and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved oruneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitanareas, need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” hours,all of which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which weare exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase ouroperating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significantcosts in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherentlyrisky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.We have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing newtechnologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in severalcountries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,which operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. We also plan to invest significantresources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our developmentbudget  efficiently  or  effectively  on  commercially  successful  and  innovative  technologies,  we  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits  of  our  strategy.  Our  newinitiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or noprior development or operating experience.

There have been numerous incidents andallegations worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwiseengaging in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct whileusing  our  platform,  Drivers  and  merchants  may  be  unwilling  to  continue  using  our  platform.  In  addition,  certain  regions  where  we  operate  have  high  rates  ofviolent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports ofDrivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. Ifother criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may beharmed, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Public reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.Further,  we  may  be  subject  to  claims  of  significant  liability  based  on  traffic  accidents,  deaths,  injuries,  or  other  incidents  that  are  caused  by  Drivers,consumers, or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, wemay face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. Inaddition, the growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable roadusers and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved oruneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitanareas, need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” hours,all of which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which weare exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase ouroperating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significantcosts in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherentlyrisky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.We have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing newtechnologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in severalcountries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,which operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. We also plan to invest significantresources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our developmentbudget  efficiently  or  effectively  on  commercially  successful  and  innovative  technologies,  we  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits  of  our  strategy.  Our  newinitiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or noprior development or operating experience.

Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, atleast in the near term.If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.Our  success  in  a  given  geographic  market  significantly  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  or  increase  our  network  scale  and  liquidity  in  that  geographicmarket by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, orelect to offer them through a competitor’s  platform, we may lack a sufficient  supply of Drivers to attract  consumers  and merchants  to our platform.  We haveexperienced and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have beenand may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a givenmarket, we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network effect that weexperience in that market. Similarly, if carriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficientsupply of carriers in specific geographic markets to attract shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in aspecific geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, wemay lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offeringwill become less appealing to consumers and merchants. A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurantgroups  and  other  merchants,  and  this  concentration  increases  the  risk  of  fluctuations  in  our  operating  results  and  our  sensitivity  to  any  material  adversedevelopments experienced by our significant restaurant partners. If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lacksufficient opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of ourplatform. An insufficient supply of platform users would decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we maybenefit from having larger network scale and liquidity than some competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcomeby smaller competitors. Maintaining a balance between supply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may bemore  important  to  service  quality  than  the  absolute  size  of  the  network.

Inaddition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptablemanner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers do not establish ormaintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-qualitysupport, or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, our revenue would decline, and ourbusiness would suffer.The number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide theirservices through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms orservices, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or otheraspects of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similarwork, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives toimprove our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.Often, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likelybe viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and securitybreaches,  including  terminating  access  to  our  platform  for  users  with  low  ratings  or  reported  incidents,  and  imposing  certain  qualifications  for  Drivers  andmerchants,  which  may  damage  our  relationships  with  platform  users  or  discourage  or  diminish  their  use  of  our  platform.  Further,  we  are  investing  in  ourautonomous  vehicle  strategy,  which  may  add  to  Driver  dissatisfaction  over  time,  as  it  may  reduce  the  need  for  Drivers.  Driver  dissatisfaction  has  in  the  pastresulted in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to makedeliveries  through  Delivery,  our  qualification  and  background  check  standards  are  generally  less  extensive  than  the  standards  for  Drivers  who  are  eligible  toprovide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materiallydifferent type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in anefficient  manner,  which  could  be  costly  and  time-consuming.  Required  changes  in  the  qualification,  screening,  and  background  check  process  (including  anychanges  to  such  processes  of  Careem,  Postmates  or  other  acquired  companies)  could  also  reduce  the  number  of  Drivers  in  those  markets  or  extend  the  timerequired  to  recruit  new  Drivers  to  our  platform,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business  and  growth.  Furthermore,  we  rely  on  a  single  background-checkprovider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms orat all.

Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made itdifficult  for  us  to  attract  and  retain  platform  users,  reduces  confidence  in  and  use  of  our  products  and  offerings,  invites  continued  legislative  and  regulatoryscrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital,increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.In 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to haveoccurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safetyincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continueto  result  in  positive  and  negative  media  coverage  and  increased  regulatory  scrutiny  and  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation  with  platform  users.  Furtherunfavorable  media  coverage  and  negative  publicity  could  adversely  impact  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects.  As  our  platform  continues  to  scale  andbecomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation couldhave an amplified effect on our various platform offerings.

For  example,  we  have  licensed  our  brand  in  connection  with  certaindivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certaincontractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality ofservice, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage andour reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently,our business.While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining agood  reputation,  minimizing  the  number  of  safety  incidents,  continuing  an  improved  culture  and  workplace  practices,  improving  our  compliance  programs,maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, andmedia  strategies  have  involved  significant  costs  and  may  not  be  successful.

Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materiallydifferent type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in anefficient  manner,  which  could  be  costly  and  time-consuming.  Required  changes  in  the  qualification,  screening,  and  background  check  process  (including  anychanges  to  such  processes  of  Careem,  Postmates  or  other  acquired  companies)  could  also  reduce  the  number  of  Drivers  in  those  markets  or  extend  the  timerequired  to  recruit  new  Drivers  to  our  platform,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business  and  growth.  Furthermore,  we  rely  on  a  single  background-checkprovider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms orat all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Driversundergoing periodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.Maintaining  and  enhancing  our  brand  and  reputation  is  critical  to  our  business  prospects.  We  have  previously  received  significant  media  coverage  andnegative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintainor enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.Maintaining  and  enhancing  our  brand  and  reputation  is  critical  to  our  ability  to  attract  new  employees  and  platform  users,  to  preserve  and  deepen  theengagement of our existing  employees and platform users, and to mitigate  legislative  or regulatory scrutiny, litigation,  government investigations,  and adverseplatform user sentiment.We have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueleddistrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made itdifficult  for  us  to  attract  and  retain  platform  users,  reduces  confidence  in  and  use  of  our  products  and  offerings,  invites  continued  legislative  and  regulatoryscrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital,increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.In 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to haveoccurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safetyincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continueto  result  in  positive  and  negative  media  coverage  and  increased  regulatory  scrutiny  and  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation  with  platform  users.  Furtherunfavorable  media  coverage  and  negative  publicity  could  adversely  impact  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects.  As  our  platform  continues  to  scale  andbecomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation couldhave an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates andCornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harmto their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.Our  brand  and  reputation  might  also  be  harmed  by  events  outside  of  our  control.  For  example,  we  have  licensed  our  brand  in  connection  with  certaindivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certaincontractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality ofservice, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage andour reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently,our business.While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining agood  reputation,  minimizing  the  number  of  safety  incidents,  continuing  an  improved  culture  and  workplace  practices,  improving  our  compliance  programs,maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, andmedia  strategies  have  involved  significant  costs  and  may  not  be  successful.  We  anticipate  that  other  competitors  and  potential  competitors  will  expand  theirofferings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain ourbrand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand andreputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.18 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat are the potential consequences of unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity on the company's brand and reputation?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What are the potential consequences of unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity on the company's brand and reputation", "answer": "The potential consequences of unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity on the company's brand and reputation include:\n\n* Adversely affecting our business prospects\n* Reducing the number of employees and platform users\n* Reducing confidence in and use of our products and offerings\n* Inviting continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny\n* Resulting in additional litigation and governmental investigations\n* Damaging our brand and reputation, which could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings\n* Adversely impacting our financial results and future prospects"}

We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentivesand  consumer  discounts  and  promotions  in  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  As  a  result  of  our  geographic  concentration,  our  business  and  financial  results  aresusceptible  to  economic,  social,  weather,  and  regulatory  conditions  or  other  circumstances  in  each  of  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  Outbreaks  of  contagiousdiseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas inwhich we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemicsor pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greaterdegree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affectour ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renewexisting  licenses  or  do  not  receive  new  licenses  in  key  metropolitan  areas  where  we  operate  or  such  licenses  are  terminated,  any  inability  to  operate  in  suchmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap onthe  number  of  new  vehicle  licenses  issued  to  drivers  who  offer  for-hire  services.  In  December  2018,  New  York  City  implemented  a  per-mile  and  per-minuteminimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financialperformance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharingtrips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle havepassed, or may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providingservices on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network issmaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetratingsuburban  and  rural  areas,  or  if  we  are  unable  to  operate  in  certain  key  metropolitan  areas  in  the  future,  our  ability  to  serve  what  we  consider  to  be  our  totaladdressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.In 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, ouroperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and fromairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to andfrom airports. Sustained declines in air travel  due to COVID-19, or other travel-related  health concerns,  could continue to suppress demand for airport-relatedMobility  and  reduce  our  Mobility  Gross  Bookings  from  airport  trips.  Certain  airports  currently  regulate  ridesharing  within  airport  boundaries,  including  bymandating  that  ridesharing  service  providers  obtain  airport-specific  licenses,  and  some  airports,  particularly  those  outside  the  United  States,  have  bannedridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking therequisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, againstus or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt ouroperations.  In  addition,  if  drop-offs  or  pick-ups  of  riders  become  inconvenient  because  of  airport  rules  or  regulations,  or  more  expensive  because  of  airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Consider the following:\n\nnetwork.\n We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomousvehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey  will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.  Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous  vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers on our platform. If a significant  number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our financial  performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.Autonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicletechnologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liabilityfor us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,and operating results.Federal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. Theseregulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substantial fines or penalties.Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business.Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our “return to office” plan,which includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability toattract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remotework, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand  feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicity could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives andemployees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.In addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We haveentered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our businessdifferently than members of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,operations, or business plans. We may not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.In addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transitioninto new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults.

{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Consider the following:\n\nnetwork.\n We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomousvehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey  will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.  Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous  vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers on our platform. If a significant  number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our financial  performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.Autonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicletechnologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liabilityfor us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,and operating results.Federal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. Theseregulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substantial fines or penalties.Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business.Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our “return to office” plan,which includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability toattract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remotework, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand  feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicity could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives andemployees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.In addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We haveentered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our businessdifferently than members of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,operations, or business plans. We may not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.In addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transitioninto new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults.

These fluctuations may be a result of a variety offactors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, andtypically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certaincities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as aresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in ourrevenue  in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  compared  to  the  second  and  third  quarters,  although  the  historical  growth  of  Delivery  has  masked  these  seasonalfluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth ofDelivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficultto  detect.  We  expect  these  seasonal  trends  to  become  more  pronounced  over  time  as  our  growth  slows.  Other  seasonal  trends  may  develop  or  these  existingseasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results mayfluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability toexpand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pacewith  technological  changes  in  the  industries  in  which  we  operate,  changes  in  governmental  or  other  regulations  affecting  our  business,  harm  to  our  brand  orreputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base ourexpense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to seasonality, our operating results mayfluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability toexpand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pacewith  technological  changes  in  the  industries  in  which  we  operate,  changes  in  governmental  or  other  regulations  affecting  our  business,  harm  to  our  brand  orreputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base ourexpense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expensesand investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed ourexpectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of theirinvestment.If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial resultsand future prospects.Our Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that theywill continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic andour ability to:•grow supply and demand on our platform;•increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;•continue to introduce our platform to new markets;•provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;•expand our business and increase our market share and category position;•compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;•develop new products, offerings, and technologies;•identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;•penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;•reduce  the  costs  of  our  Mobility  offering  to  better  compete  with  personal  vehicle  ownership  and  usage  and  other  low-cost  alternatives  like  publictransportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;•maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;•enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy,Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and•increase positive perception of our brand.We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemmingfrom continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrierdemand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees invarious jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adverselyimpacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will notachieve profitability.23 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat are the factors that the company believes will impact its growth and profitability in the future?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What are the factors that the company believes will impact its growth and profitability in the future", "answer": "The company believes that the following factors will impact its growth and profitability in the future:\n\n1.

As  we  expand  our  operations,  we  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breaches  experienced  by  the  companies  we  acquire.  Forexample, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed accessto certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other datasecurity  breaches,  or  if  we  fail  to  remediate  this  or  any  other  data  security  breach  that  Careem  or  we  experience,  we  may  face  harm  to  our  brand,  businessdisruption, and significant liabilities.If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we mayfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the developmentof new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. Forexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any suchnew  or  upgraded  products,  offerings,  or  features  may  not  work  as  intended  or  may  not  provide  intended  value  to  platform  users.  For  example,  some  productchanges  in  California  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,  reduced  demand  for  rides  and  reduced  supply  of  Drivers  on  our  platform,  Driverdissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation of our platform.

If the internal systems and toolswe use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. Whilethese numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges inmeasuring  how  our  products  are  used  across  large  populations  globally.

This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.  The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  ourtechnology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash forridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significantfines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use ofcash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent orfatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers whileusing our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which couldadversely impact our business.In addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit thecash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are notalways effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and wecannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect toa variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systemsfail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Suchcollection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,impact our financial performance.Loss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantlylimit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry(“PCI”) and Data Security Standard (the “Standard”). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developedby the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and othernetwork operating  rules could result  in fines or restrictions  on our ability  to accept payment  cards. Under certain circumstances  specified in the payment cardnetwork rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities mayreveal  that  we  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  Standard.  If  an  audit,  self-  assessment,  or  other  test  determines  that  we  need  to  take  steps  to  remediate  anydeficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt newoperating  rules  or  interpret  existing  rules  that  we  or  our  processors  might  find  difficult  or  even  impossible  to  follow,  or  costly  to  implement.  In  addition  toviolations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receiveincentives  from  them,  could  increase  our  costs,  or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business.

Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect toa variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systemsfail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Suchcollection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,impact our financial performance.Loss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantlylimit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry(“PCI”) and Data Security Standard (the “Standard”). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developedby the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and othernetwork operating  rules could result  in fines or restrictions  on our ability  to accept payment  cards. Under certain circumstances  specified in the payment cardnetwork rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities mayreveal  that  we  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  Standard.  If  an  audit,  self-  assessment,  or  other  test  determines  that  we  need  to  take  steps  to  remediate  anydeficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt newoperating  rules  or  interpret  existing  rules  that  we  or  our  processors  might  find  difficult  or  even  impossible  to  follow,  or  costly  to  implement.  In  addition  toviolations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receiveincentives  from  them,  could  increase  our  costs,  or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business.  The  loss  of  our  credit  card  acceptance  privileges  for  any  one  of  thesereasons, or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue,and operating results.Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms andmobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the informationtechnology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data,including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware,viruses, spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreatsare constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticatedcyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security ofour systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitiveposition, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adverselyaffect our reputation, business and operating results.Various other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy,issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, orbreaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gainaccess to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effectivemanner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the28 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat are some of the potential consequences of a cyberattack on Careem's information technology systems?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What are some of the potential consequences of a cyberattack on Careem's information technology systems?", "answer": "Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future.

{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Consider the following:\n\nIf\n platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability to attractand retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financialcondition, and operating results.We are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or otherwise, and we may be unableto protect or provide a safe environment for Drivers and consumers as a result of certain actions by Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, and third parties. Suchactions  may  result  in  injuries,  property  damage,  or  loss  of  life  for  consumers  and  third  parties,  or  business  interruption,  brand  and  reputational  damage,  orsignificant liabilities for us. Although we administer certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers throughthird-party service providers, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in certainjurisdictions  according  to  national  and  local  laws,  and  our  third-party  service  providers  may  fail  to  conduct  such  background  checks  adequately  or  discloseinformation  that  could  be  relevant  to  a  determination  of  eligibility.  Further,  the  qualification  and  background  check  standards  for  Couriers  are  generally  lessextensive than those conducted for Mobility Drivers. In addition, we do not independently test Drivers’ driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue toreceive complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have also faced civillitigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety ofour platform.If Drivers or carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform asa conduit for criminal activity, consumers and shippers may not consider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result ofour business relationship with such Driver or carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents andallegations worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwiseengaging in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct whileusing  our  platform,  Drivers  and  merchants  may  be  unwilling  to  continue  using  our  platform.  In  addition,  certain  regions  where  we  operate  have  high  rates  ofviolent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports ofDrivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. Ifother criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may beharmed, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Public reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.Further,  we  may  be  subject  to  claims  of  significant  liability  based  on  traffic  accidents,  deaths,  injuries,  or  other  incidents  that  are  caused  by  Drivers,consumers, or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, wemay face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. Inaddition, the growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable roadusers and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved oruneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitanareas, need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” hours,all of which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which weare exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase ouroperating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significantcosts in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherentlyrisky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.We have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing newtechnologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in severalcountries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,which operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. We also plan to invest significantresources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our developmentbudget  efficiently  or  effectively  on  commercially  successful  and  innovative  technologies,  we  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits  of  our  strategy.  Our  newinitiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or noprior development or operating experience.

Our growth strategyhas  also  included  the  divestment  of  certain  lines  of  businesses  in  its  entirety,  and  not  just  in  certain  jurisdictions,  and  instead  partnering  and  investing  in  ourcompetitors  in  those  lines  of  businesses.  As  a  result,  a  significant  portion  of  our  assets  includes  minority  ownership  positions,  including  in  Didi,  Grab,  ourYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, Zomato and Aurora.Our ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors ofDidi or Zomato, and therefore we do not participate in the day-to-day management of Didi or Zomato or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi andZomato. We are not represented on the management teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day  management  of  Grab,  our  Yandex.Taxi  joint  venture,  Lime  or  Aurora.  Although  we  are  represented  on  each  of  the  boards  of  directors  of  Grab,  ourYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime and Aurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams ofthese  companies  may  make  decisions  or  take  actions  with  which  we  disagree  or  that  may  be  harmful  to  the  value  of  our  ownership  in  these  companies.Additionally, these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in variousmarkets throughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results,and prospects would be adversely affected by such expansion into markets in which we operate.Any material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of theseassets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affectsuch valuations.  To the extent  these businesses are or become publicly traded  companies, volatility  or fluctuations  in the stock price of such companies couldadversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companieshave limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limitedpublic information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particulareconomic,  tax,  political,  legal,  safety,  regulatory  and  public  health  risks,  including  the  extent  of  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  on  their  business;  aredomiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and effortsof a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect onthe relevant company’s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitivepositions. Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operatingresults, or the trading price of our common stock.Further, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora’s November 2021 initial publicoffering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Other than Aurora, Grab, Didi and Zomato, there is currently no public market forany of these securities, and there may be no market in the future if and when we decide to sell such assets. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at atime at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment companyunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we wouldnot be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets.Accordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.We may  experience  significant  fluctuations  in  our operating  results.  If  we are unable  to achieve  or sustain  profitability,  our  prospects  would  be adverselyaffected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.22 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the main reason for the company's difficulties in implementing and maintaining financial systems and processes?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the main reason for the company's difficulties in implementing and maintaining financial systems and processes", "answer": "I do not know"}

Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous  vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers on our platform. If a significant  number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our financial  performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.Autonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicletechnologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liabilityfor us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,and operating results.Federal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. Theseregulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substantial fines or penalties.Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business.Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our “return to office” plan,which includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability toattract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remotework, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand  feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicity could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives andemployees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.In addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We haveentered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our businessdifferently than members of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,operations, or business plans. We may not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.In addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transitioninto new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personneltransitions has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, andyears of industry experience. If we cannot effectively  manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future businessprospects could be adversely affected.To attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to attract and retain the personnelwe require to operate our business effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract,25 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the name of the company that has introduced a commercialized ride-hailing fleet of autonomous vehicles?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the name of the company that has introduced a commercialized ride-hailing fleet of autonomous vehicles", "answer": "Waymo"}

If  we  are  unable  to  attract  and  retain  high-quality  management  and  operating  personnel,  ourbusiness, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.The impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.Our performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets,  taxation,  energy  prices,  interest  rates,  consumer  confidence,  and  other  macroeconomic  factors.  Consumer  preferences  tend  to  shift  to  lower-costalternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending atmany of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.Factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  fuel  prices,  and  increased  vehicle  purchase,  rental,  or  maintenance  costs,  including  increased  prices  of  new  and  usedvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.Similarly,  factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  food  costs,  increased  labor  and  employee  benefit  costs,  increased  rental  costs,  and  increased  energy  costs  mayincrease merchant operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs arebeyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or toseek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likelycause order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipmentson our  platform  to  decline.  A  decreased  supply  of Drivers,  consumers,  merchants,  shippers,  or carriers  on our  platform  would  decrease  our  network  liquidity,which could harm our business and operating results.If we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietaryor confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.We collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers’ licensenumbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information. As such, we are anattractive target of data security attacks by third parties. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure,alteration or destruction of, any such data could result in significant liability and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation andbrand, a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business. We rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwiseprocess some of our data and that of platform users, and any failure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use,acquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, such information could have similar adverse consequences for us.Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often unrecognizableuntil launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative measures. Our servers and platform may bevulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not detect. Individuals able to circumvent our security measuresmay  misappropriate  confidential,  proprietary,  or  personal  information  held  by  or  on  behalf  of  us,  disrupt  our  operations,  damage  our  computers,  or  otherwisedamage our business. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches,including potential liability that may not be limited to the amounts covered by our insurance.Security breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmentalinvestigation.

As  we  expand  our  operations,  we  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breaches  experienced  by  the  companies  we  acquire.  Forexample, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed accessto certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other datasecurity  breaches,  or  if  we  fail  to  remediate  this  or  any  other  data  security  breach  that  Careem  or  we  experience,  we  may  face  harm  to  our  brand,  businessdisruption, and significant liabilities.If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we mayfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the developmentof new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. Forexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any suchnew  or  upgraded  products,  offerings,  or  features  may  not  work  as  intended  or  may  not  provide  intended  value  to  platform  users.  For  example,  some  productchanges  in  California  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,  reduced  demand  for  rides  and  reduced  supply  of  Drivers  on  our  platform,  Driverdissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, orif platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which wouldadversely affect our operating results.We  track  certain  operational  metrics  and  our  category  position  with  internal  systems  and  tools,  and  our  equity  stakes  in  minority-owned  affiliates  withinformation  provided  by  such  minority-owned  affiliates,  and  do  not  independently  verify  such  metrics.  Certain  of  our  operational  metrics  are  subject  toinherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.We track certain  operational  metrics, including key metrics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position, with internal systems andtools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, that are not independently verified by anythird party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions onwhich we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which couldresult in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose, or our estimates of our category position. If the internal systems and toolswe use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. Whilethese numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges inmeasuring  how  our  products  are  used  across  large  populations  globally.  For  example,  we  believe  that  there  are  consumers  who  have  multiple  accounts,  eventhough we prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to howwe measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-termstrategies.

We use the results ofthese regular checks to better understand employees’ needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, andgrowth opportunities. For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was createdbased on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operationsthrough monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.Employee  Development  and  Retention.  We  believe  that  employees  who  have  opportunities  for  development  are  more  engaged,  satisfied,  and  productive.Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uberthrough internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enablethem to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promotewellness  and  productivity.  This  helps  our  diverse  employee  base  manage  life’s  expected  and  unexpected  events.  Globally,  Uber  offers  competitive  benefitspackages to our employees and their families. We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique populations.For additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, futureattrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our2021 People and Culture Report, which is available on our website.

We  believe  that  when  employees  feel  empowered  to  succeed  in  a  workenvironment  that celebrates,  supports, and invests in diversity,  progress follows.

For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women,LGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadershiproles come from historically underrepresented groups.Our Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensationpackages of our most senior executives.We encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber’s People Team or theIntegrity Helpline.As a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially.

A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain availableto anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible,  flexible,  independent  work  has  offered  an  option  for  many  workers  historically  marginalized  from  the  labor  market  and  has  enabled  widegeographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using anapp to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generallypatchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker iseither an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. AtUber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovativeways to address these issues.•Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all workshould be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber—and otherapp based companies—to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples ofour advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:◦In  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  onpolicymakers, platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work—one where having accessto protections and benefits doesn’t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.◦In California, we welcomed  the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements  for platform companies  like Uber to providebenefits, including healthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.◦In the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant tothis change, drivers who use Uber’s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paidholiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an evenstronger voice to drivers and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.•Protections  and benefits:  We  partner  with  leading  insurance  companies  around  the  world  to  pioneer  protections  for  independent  workers,  includingimplementing additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.•Earnings:  We  are  continually  developing  new  technology  that  Drivers  can  use  to  acquire  information  that  may  help  them  save  on  costs  and  makeinformed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).•Progression:  We  have  partnered  with  Arizona  State  University  to  offer  eligible  Drivers  and  their  family  members  access  to  over  100  undergraduatedegree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship.

If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collectingthe payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies forvaluing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our futureincome taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions  that  have  higher  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  allowance  on  our  U.S.  and  Netherlands'  deferred  tax  assets,  or  changes  in  tax  laws,regulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, andcurrently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financialposition and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment byour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ fromthe amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Ourtax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future,which  could  impact  our  financial  position.  In  addition,  in  connection  with  any  planned  or  future  acquisitions,  we  may  acquire  businesses  that  have  differinglicenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than ourlicenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certainjurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financialstatements, and could adversely affect our financial results.Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and modified in2020, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and regulations promulgated in connection therewith remainunclear  in  many  respects  and  could  be  subject  to  potential  amendments  and  technical  corrections,  as  well  as  interpretations  and  incremental  implementingregulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. Inaddition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.We are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potentialchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We couldbecome subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmentalbodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted andhistorically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our taxobligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expandingscale of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm ourfinancial position, operating results, and cash flows.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.As of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and$12.4 billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January1, 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating losscarryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset futureincome  tax  liabilities,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  In  addition,  under  Sections  382  and  383  of  the  IRC,  if  a  corporationundergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’sability to use its pre-change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset itspost-change  income  may  be  limited.  Many  U.S. states  follow  similar  rules  for  restricting  use  of  tax  attributes  after  an  ownership  change.  We  may  experienceownership  changes  in  the  future  because  of  subsequent  shifts  in  our  stock  ownership.  As  a  result,  if  we  earn  net  taxable  income,  our  ability  to  use  our  pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, whichcould potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.33 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the total amount of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes as of December 31, 2021?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the total amount of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes as of December 31, 2021", "answer": "The total amount of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes as of December 31, 2021 is $14.9 billion for U.S. federal income tax purposes and $12.4 billion for state income tax purposes"}

Although we havedeveloped, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirableactivities  on  our  platform,  and  security  breaches,  we  cannot  guarantee  that  such  measures  will  provide  absolute  security.  Our  efforts  on  this  front  may  beunsuccessful  as  a  result  of,  for  example,  software  bugs  or  other  technical  malfunctions;  employee,  contractor,  or  vendor  error  or  malfeasance;  governmentsurveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure tomaintain  the  performance,  reliability,  security,  and  availability  of  our  products,  offerings,  and  technical  infrastructure  to  the  satisfaction  of  platform  users  andcertain regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business,and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business.Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependentupon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in thefuture contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in oursoftware, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactionsbetween systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact theavailability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future thatcould result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control,such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platformusers may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, ourrelease of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Anyerrors,  bugs,  or  vulnerabilities  discovered  in  our  code  or  systems  after  release  could  result  in  an  interruption  in  the  availability  of  our  platform  or  a  negativeexperience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to ourreputation,  loss of platform  users, loss of revenue  or liability  for  damages,  regulatory  inquiries,  or other  proceedings,  any of which could  adversely  affect  ourbusiness and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks.AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial datapractices by us or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine thedecisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, andbrand or reputational harm.We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adverselyimpacted.We  face  climate  change  related  physical  and  transition  risks,  which  include  the  risk  of  market  shifts  toward  electric  vehicles  (“EVs”)  and  lower  carbonbusiness models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and durationof extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-partysuppliers, and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs tomaintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% ofvehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Driversmay be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adoptedin London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent weexperience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.We  have  made  climate  related  commitments  that  require  us  to  invest  significant  effort,  resources,  and  management  time  and  circumstances  may  arise,including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.We have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to netzero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct setsenvironmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towardsour  climate  commitments  requires  us  to  invest  significant  effort,  resources,  and  management  time,  and  circumstances  may  arise,  including  those  beyond  ourcontrol, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments.

In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure  to pay increased  fees to banks to process funds, and there  is noassurance that such online payment providers will not pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us. If these fees increase over time, our operatingcosts will increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, and havecaused  substantial  Driver  dissatisfaction  and  generated  a  significant  number  of  Driver  complaints.  Future  failures  of  the  payment  processing  infrastructureunderlying our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment operations and could cause them to instead use our competitors’ platforms. If the qualityor  convenience  of  our  payment  processing  infrastructure  declines  as  a  result  of  these  limitations  or  for  any  other  reason,  the  attractiveness  of  our  business  toDrivers,  merchants,  and  carriers  could  be  adversely  affected.  If  we  are  forced  to  migrate  to  other  third-party  payment  service  providers  for  any  reason,  thetransition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.We currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any interruptions or delays in servicesfrom these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and offerings and harm our business.We use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do not control the physicaloperation  of  any  of  the  co-located  data  centers  we  use  or  the  operations  of  our  third-party  service  providers.  These  third-party  operations  and  co-located  datacenters  may  experience  break-ins,  computer  viruses,  denial-of-service  attacks,  sabotage,  acts  of  vandalism,  and  other  misconduct.  These  facilities  may  also  bevulnerable  to  damage  or  interruption  from  power  loss,  telecommunications  failures,  fires,  floods,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  tornadoes,  and  similar  events.  Oursystems do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party serviceproviders to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or requireus to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service. This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss ofdata, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switchto another  cloud or data center  provider in the event of any disruptions  or interference  to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data centerproviders are subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our co-located data center facilitieshave no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities oncommercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center isarranged. Interruptions in the delivery of our products and offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and carriers to stop offering their servicesthrough  our  platform,  and  reduce  use  of  our  platform  by  consumers  and  shippers.  Our  business  and  operating  results  may  be  harmed  if  current  and  potentialDrivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers believe our platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computationalcapacity sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised,which would have an adverse effect on our growth and business.Our use of third-party open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to possible litigation.We use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that use third-party open sourcesoftware have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may besubject  to  suits  by  parties  claiming  ownership  of  what  we  believe  to  be  open  source  software,  or  claiming  non-compliance  with  the  applicable  open  sourcelicensing terms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open sourcesoftware to make available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designedto monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete opensource license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicableterms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number ofopen-source  software  license  types,  almost  none  of  which  have  been  tested  in  a  court  of  law,  resulting  in  a  dearth  of  guidance  regarding  the  proper  legalinterpretation of such licenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publiclyrelease certain portions of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.In addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source  licensors  generally  do  not  provide  warranties  or  controls  on  the  functionality  or  origin  of  the  software.

Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business,financial condition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.Financing and Transactional RisksWe will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.To continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings,and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution,and  any  new  equity  securities  we  issue  may  have  rights,  preferences,  and  privileges  superior  to  those  of  existing  stockholders.  Certain  of  our  existing  debtinstruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness andother financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, ourexisting debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financingon favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to supportour business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness maylimit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.As of December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $238 million ofCareem  Convertible  Notes  remain  subject  to  future  issuance  to  Careem  stockholders  as  of  December  31,  2021.  Subject  to  the  limitations  in  the  terms  of  ourexisting and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may needto incur additional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments willreduce  the funds available  to us for  working capital,  capital  expenditures,  and other  corporate  purposes and limit  our ability  to obtain  additional  financing  forworking capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten ourvulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business andthe industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cashflow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness,or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generatecash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations,including  limitations  on  incurring  additional  indebtedness  and  liens,  limitations  on  certain  consolidations,  mergers,  and  sales  of  assets,  and  restrictions  on  thepayment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raisingactivities  and  other  financial  and  operational  matters,  which  may  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  obtain  additional  capital  to  pursue  business  opportunities,including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit ourability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section titled “Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.”We may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities.The tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different companies. For example, wemay become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many othermultinational  corporations,  we are  subject  to tax  in multiple  U.S. and foreign  jurisdictions  and have structured  our operations  to reduce  our effective  tax  rate.Currently,  certain  jurisdictions  are  investigating  our  compliance  with  tax  rules.  If  it  is  determined  that  we  are  not  compliant  with  such  rules,  we  could  oweadditional taxes.Certain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowedto contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those mattersare being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subjectto such taxes; even when such payments32 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the total outstanding indebtedness of the company as of December 31, 2021?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the total outstanding indebtedness of the company as of December 31, 2021", "answer": "The total outstanding indebtedness of the company as of December 31, 2021 is $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount"}

Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisitionand our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company’s brand.In  addition,  our  acquisition  of  Careem  has  increased  our  risks  under  the  U.S. Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (“FCPA”)  and  other  similar  laws  outside  theUnited States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not proveeffective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.We  may not receive  a favorable  return  on investment  for  prior  or future  business  combinations,  and we cannot  predict  whether  these  transactions  will  beaccretive  to  the  value  of  our  common  stock.  It  is  also  possible  that  acquisitions,  combinations,  divestitures,  joint  ventures,  or  other  strategic  transactions  weannounce  could  be  viewed  negatively  by  the  press,  investors,  platform  users,  or  regulators,  any  or  all  of  which  may  adversely  affect  our  reputation  and  ourbusiness. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our BusinessWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify ourbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.In certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model hasbeen blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in suchjurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,”including with respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person. Two new conditions(which we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Anyinability  to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,  and  operating  results.  We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019, MexicoCity’s  Secretaría  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  aprohibition  on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  arequirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection,we have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust 2019, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new “cruisingcap,” intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although such “cruising cap” was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. Inaddition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted incountries outside the United States.

{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Consider the following:\n\njurisdictions impose sim\nilar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.In certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or thatwe believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers whoused the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat  we  violated  local  competition  laws.  In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision tocontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of thispractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decisionas  a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers’  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate inaccordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required tocomply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.As  of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.  We  are  subject  to  differing,  andsometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national,regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our businessmodel. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting howwe operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may beadopted.Further, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws andregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency  medicaltransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit or block our ability  to offer  our products to Drivers and consumers  in those jurisdictions,  thereby impeding overall  use of our platform. We are activelychallenging  some  of  these  laws  and  regulations  and  are  lobbying  other  jurisdictions  to  oppose  similar  restrictions  on  our  business,  especially  our  ridesharingservices. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London’s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an “Ultra Low Emissions Zone” that went into effectin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California tohave been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require usto share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordancewith these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt oneither a temporary or indefinite basis.Additionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (“EU”), an event commonly36 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the number of cities and countries where the company's platform is available as of December 31, 2021?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the number of cities and countries where the company's platform is available as of December 31, 2021", "answer": "approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries"}

In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers whoused the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat  we  violated  local  competition  laws.  In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision tocontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of thispractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decisionas  a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers’  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate inaccordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required tocomply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.As  of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.

{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Consider the following:\n\nreferred to as Brexit. Th\ne UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.In addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto,  among  other  things,  transportation,  competition,  advertising,  consumer  protection,  fee  calculations,  personal  injuries,  privacy,  intellectual  property,  productliability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the SupremeCourt of Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regionsof Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould harm our ability  to operate  our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions  in which we operate,  which could adversely  affect  our business,revenue, and operating results.In addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negativepublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition  authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices aretoo high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour  business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.  Further,  any  new  requirements  or  restrictions,  or  proposed  requirements  or  restrictions,  could  result  in  adversepublicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.In  addition,  governmental  agencies  and  regulators  may,  among  other  things,  prohibit  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  or  combinations  we  plan  to  make,impose  significant  fines  or penalties,  require  divestiture  of  certain  of our  assets,  or impose  other  restrictions  that  limit  or require  us to modify  our operations,including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we dobusiness and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financialcondition, or operating results.We expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focuson the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of aninvestigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limitour future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine thatcertain  aspects  of  our  business  are  subject  to  these  laws  and  could  require  us  to  obtain  licenses  to  continue  to  operate  in  such  jurisdictions.  For  example,  oursubsidiary  in  the  Netherlands,  Uber  Payments  B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  by  its  competent  authority,  De  Nederlandsche  Bank,  as  an  electronic  moneyinstitution.  This  authorization  permits  Uber  Payments  B.V.  to  provide  payment  services  (including  acquiring  and  executing  payment  transactions  and  moneyremittances,  as  referred  to  in  the  Revised  Payment  Services  Directive  (2015/2366/EU))  and  to  issue  electronic  money  in  the  Netherlands.  In  addition,  UberPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. Wecontinue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and supportthe future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our businessoperations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease orlimit business37 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat percentage of the company's global Mobility Gross Bookings did the UK represent in 2021?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What percentage of the company's global Mobility Gross Bookings did the UK represent in 2021", "answer": "8.3"}

We may issue our shares of commonstock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investmentsor otherwise. For example, on December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Postmates for aggregate consideration of approximately 70 million shares of ourcommon stock and equity awards covering approximately 13 million shares of our common stock. This and any other such issuance, including the issuance ofadditional shares of our common stock upon exercise of such equity awards, could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the tradingprice of our common stock to decline.We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock.

In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectivenessof  our  internal  control  over  financial  annually.  We  currently  are  required  to  disclose  changes  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  have  materiallyaffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly andchallenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in sizeand complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline requiredfor a public company. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control overfinancial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growthofferings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintaininternal  control  over  financial  reporting  could  severely  inhibit  our  ability  to  accurately  report  our  financial  condition  or  operating  results.  If  we  are  unable  toconclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a materialweakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the marketprice of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SECor other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these andother effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.ITEM 1B.

{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Consider the following:\n\nAustralia Class Action\nIn May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf ofcertain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during theperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. Theclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We denythese allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.Other Legal ProceedingsWhile  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  outcome  of  the  legal  actions,  investigations,  and  proceedings  brought  against  us,  we  believe  that,  except  for  thematters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could bematerial  to  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  in  any  one  accounting  period.  We  are  currently  involved  in,  and  may  in  the  future  be  involved  in,  legalproceedings,  litigation,  claims,  and  government  investigations  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  In  addition,  the  nature  of  our  business  exposes  us  to  claimsrelated to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the UnitedStates where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and governmentinvestigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, andgovernment investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorablepreliminary and interim rulings.ITEM 4.

Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisitionand our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company’s brand.In  addition,  our  acquisition  of  Careem  has  increased  our  risks  under  the  U.S. Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (“FCPA”)  and  other  similar  laws  outside  theUnited States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not proveeffective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.We  may not receive  a favorable  return  on investment  for  prior  or future  business  combinations,  and we cannot  predict  whether  these  transactions  will  beaccretive  to  the  value  of  our  common  stock.  It  is  also  possible  that  acquisitions,  combinations,  divestitures,  joint  ventures,  or  other  strategic  transactions  weannounce  could  be  viewed  negatively  by  the  press,  investors,  platform  users,  or  regulators,  any  or  all  of  which  may  adversely  affect  our  reputation  and  ourbusiness. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our BusinessWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify ourbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.In certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model hasbeen blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in suchjurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,”including with respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person. Two new conditions(which we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Anyinability  to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,  and  operating  results.  We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019, MexicoCity’s  Secretaría  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  aprohibition  on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  arequirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection,we have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust 2019, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new “cruisingcap,” intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although such “cruising cap” was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago.

{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Consider the following:\n\npayments\n apps continue to operate in parallel with Uber’s apps and each company’s engineering, human resources, and operations teams will continue to operateindependently and report to such company’s own Chief Executive Officer. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisitionand our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company’s brand.In  addition,  our  acquisition  of  Careem  has  increased  our  risks  under  the  U.S. Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (“FCPA”)  and  other  similar  laws  outside  theUnited States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not proveeffective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.We  may not receive  a favorable  return  on investment  for  prior  or future  business  combinations,  and we cannot  predict  whether  these  transactions  will  beaccretive  to  the  value  of  our  common  stock.  It  is  also  possible  that  acquisitions,  combinations,  divestitures,  joint  ventures,  or  other  strategic  transactions  weannounce  could  be  viewed  negatively  by  the  press,  investors,  platform  users,  or  regulators,  any  or  all  of  which  may  adversely  affect  our  reputation  and  ourbusiness. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our BusinessWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify ourbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.In certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model hasbeen blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in suchjurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,”including with respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person. Two new conditions(which we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Anyinability  to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,  and  operating  results.  We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019, MexicoCity’s  Secretaría  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  aprohibition  on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  arequirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection,we have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust 2019, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new “cruisingcap,” intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although such “cruising cap” was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago.

Th\ne UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.In addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto,  among  other  things,  transportation,  competition,  advertising,  consumer  protection,  fee  calculations,  personal  injuries,  privacy,  intellectual  property,  productliability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the SupremeCourt of Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regionsof Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould harm our ability  to operate  our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions  in which we operate,  which could adversely  affect  our business,revenue, and operating results.In addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negativepublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition  authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices aretoo high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour  business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.  Further,  any  new  requirements  or  restrictions,  or  proposed  requirements  or  restrictions,  could  result  in  adversepublicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.In  addition,  governmental  agencies  and  regulators  may,  among  other  things,  prohibit  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  or  combinations  we  plan  to  make,impose  significant  fines  or penalties,  require  divestiture  of  certain  of our  assets,  or impose  other  restrictions  that  limit  or require  us to modify  our operations,including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we dobusiness and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financialcondition, or operating results.We expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focuson the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of aninvestigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limitour future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine thatcertain  aspects  of  our  business  are  subject  to  these  laws  and  could  require  us  to  obtain  licenses  to  continue  to  operate  in  such  jurisdictions.  For  example,  oursubsidiary  in  the  Netherlands,  Uber  Payments  B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  by  its  competent  authority,  De  Nederlandsche  Bank,  as  an  electronic  moneyinstitution.

In  addition,  UberPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA.

In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed asa  payment  services  provider.  Were  local  regulators  to  determine  that  such  arrangements  require  us  to  be  so  licensed,  such  regulators  may  block  payments  toDrivers, merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantialdelay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and  prospects.  Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting  all  necessary  authentication  steps.  Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived  by  those  users.  A  substantial  increase  in  the  frequency  with  which  we  make  Driver  payments  without  having  received  corresponding  payments  fromconsumers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.In  addition,  laws  related  to  money  transmission  and  online  payments  are  evolving,  and  changes  in  such  laws  could  affect  our  ability  to  provide  paymentprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith  changes  to  the  EU  Payment  Services  Directive,  caused  aspects  of  our  payment  operations  in  the  EEA  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  European  paymentsregulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. EffectiveJuly 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulations.In addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic fundstransfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and exportrestrictions.  Our  business  operations,  including  our  payments  to  Drivers  and  merchants,  may  not  always  comply  with  these  financial  laws  and  regulations.Historical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,or other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits onour ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.Further, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,and payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money launderingand  sanctions  laws,  and  in  the  EEA  to  conduct  appropriate  risk  assessments  and  implement  appropriate  controls  as  a  regulated  financial  service  provider.Government  authorities  may  seek  to  bring  legal  action  against  us  if  our  payment  system  is  used  for  improper  or  illegal  purposes  or  if  our  enterprise  riskmanagement or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to ourbusiness.We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices and otherU.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.We  are  the  subject  of  DOJ  criminal  and  civil  inquiries  and  investigations,  as  well  as  civil  enforcement  inquiries  and  investigations  by  other  governmentagencies, including state AG offices in the United States and abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our businesspractices, such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved thebreach of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future,settle claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with theAttorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related toour failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach andthe 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December2018, U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately  $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and maycontinue to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially materialfines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued aproposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US SafetyReport.

We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money launderingand  sanctions  laws,  and  in  the  EEA  to  conduct  appropriate  risk  assessments  and  implement  appropriate  controls  as  a  regulated  financial  service  provider.Government  authorities  may  seek  to  bring  legal  action  against  us  if  our  payment  system  is  used  for  improper  or  illegal  purposes  or  if  our  enterprise  riskmanagement or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to ourbusiness.We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices and otherU.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.We  are  the  subject  of  DOJ  criminal  and  civil  inquiries  and  investigations,  as  well  as  civil  enforcement  inquiries  and  investigations  by  other  governmentagencies, including state AG offices in the United States and abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our businesspractices, such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved thebreach of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future,settle claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with theAttorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related toour failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach andthe 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December2018, U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately  $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and maycontinue to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially materialfines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued aproposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US SafetyReport. We negotiated the total payment to $9.1538 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the potential impact of the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) regulatory requirements on the company's platform user experience?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the potential impact of the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) regulatory requirements on the company's platform user experience?", "answer": "The potential impact of the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) regulatory requirements on the company's platform user experience is that it will require platform users to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction, which may make the platform user experience substantially less convenient.

In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed asa  payment  services  provider.  Were  local  regulators  to  determine  that  such  arrangements  require  us  to  be  so  licensed,  such  regulators  may  block  payments  toDrivers, merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantialdelay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and  prospects.  Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting  all  necessary  authentication  steps.  Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived  by  those  users.  A  substantial  increase  in  the  frequency  with  which  we  make  Driver  payments  without  having  received  corresponding  payments  fromconsumers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.In  addition,  laws  related  to  money  transmission  and  online  payments  are  evolving,  and  changes  in  such  laws  could  affect  our  ability  to  provide  paymentprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith  changes  to  the  EU  Payment  Services  Directive,  caused  aspects  of  our  payment  operations  in  the  EEA  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  European  paymentsregulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. EffectiveJuly 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulations.In addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic fundstransfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and exportrestrictions.  Our  business  operations,  including  our  payments  to  Drivers  and  merchants,  may  not  always  comply  with  these  financial  laws  and  regulations.Historical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,or other enforcement actions.

Any of these developments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.The nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.These  and any future  privacy  or security  incidents  could result  in violation  of applicable  U.S. and international  privacy,  data protection,  and other laws. Suchviolations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatoryentities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been thesubject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuantto which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how weprotect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,future failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, U.K., Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately$1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. In January 2016, we entered into a settlement with theOffice  of the New York State Attorney General  under which we agreed  to enhance  our data security  practices.  In September  2018, we entered  into stipulatedjudgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 millionand assurances  that we would enhance  our data security  and privacy  practices.  Failure  to comply with these and other orders could result  in substantial  fines,enforcement  actions,  injunctive  relief,  and  other  penalties  that  may  be  costly  or  that  may  impact  our  business.  We  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breachesexperienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatoryauthorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breachthat Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potentialclaims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.This  risk  is  enhanced  in  certain  jurisdictions  with  stringent  privacy  laws  and,  as  we  expand  our  products,  offerings,  and  operations  domestically  andinternationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacyand security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use ofpersonal  data,  strengthened  individual  data  rights,  data  breach  requirements,  limitations  on  data  retention,  strengthened  requirements  for  special  categories  ofpersonal  data  and  pseudonymised  (i.e.,  key-coded)  data,  and  additional  obligations  for  contracting  with  service  providers  that  may  process  personal  data.  TheGDPR  further  provides  that  EU  member  states  may  institute  additional  laws  and  regulations  impacting  the  processing  of  personal  data,  including  (i)  specialcategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automatedindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties, including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Otherjurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020.

We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor  obtaining  or  maintaining  a  license  or  otherwise,  from  law  enforcement  agencies,  and  from  intelligence  agencies.  This  disclosure  may  result  in  a  failure  orperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us inthe same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto  suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessing  significant  fines  or  penalties  against  us  or  shutting  down  our  or  Careem’s  app  on  either  atemporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the mannerin which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thuscompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceivedfailure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us byindividuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, iffound liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit ourability to operate our business.We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legalproceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We aresubject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectualproperty infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any suchlitigation,  investigations,  and  legal  proceedings  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  expensive.  Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  timeconsuming,  costly,  and  harmful  to  our  reputation,  and  could  require  significant  amounts  of  management  time  and  corporate  resources.  If  any  of  these  legalproceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced tochange the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In  addition,  we  regularly  include  arbitration  provisions  in  our  terms  of  service  with  end-users.  These  provisions  are  intended  to  streamline  the  litigationprocess for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration maybecome more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certainrisks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may inthe future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increaseour  litigation  costs  and  exposure  in  respect  of  such  proceedings.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during theperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. Theclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We denythese allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.Other Legal ProceedingsWhile  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  outcome  of  the  legal  actions,  investigations,  and  proceedings  brought  against  us,  we  believe  that,  except  for  thematters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could bematerial  to  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  in  any  one  accounting  period.  We  are  currently  involved  in,  and  may  in  the  future  be  involved  in,  legalproceedings,  litigation,  claims,  and  government  investigations  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  In  addition,  the  nature  of  our  business  exposes  us  to  claimsrelated to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the UnitedStates where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and governmentinvestigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, andgovernment investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorablepreliminary and interim rulings.ITEM 4.

We have elected toomit  discussion  on  the  earliest  of  the  three  years  covered  by  the  consolidated  financial  statements  presented.  Refer  to  Item  7.  Management's  Discussion  andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed on March 1,2021, for reference to discussion of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented.In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates,and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should review the sections titled “Special NoteRegarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of forward-looking statements and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, for a discussion of factors thatcould cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion andanalysis and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from pointA to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providersof ride services and merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers withpublic transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freightindustry. We are also developing technologies that provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.48 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the date that Uber's common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the date that Uber's common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)", "answer": "May 10, 2019"}
{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Consider the following:\n\npassed in California in Novembe\nr 2020.Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personaldata outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor  obtaining  or  maintaining  a  license  or  otherwise,  from  law  enforcement  agencies,  and  from  intelligence  agencies.  This  disclosure  may  result  in  a  failure  orperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us inthe same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto  suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessing  significant  fines  or  penalties  against  us  or  shutting  down  our  or  Careem’s  app  on  either  atemporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the mannerin which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thuscompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceivedfailure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us byindividuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, iffound liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit ourability to operate our business.We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legalproceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We aresubject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectualproperty infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any suchlitigation,  investigations,  and  legal  proceedings  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  expensive.  Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  timeconsuming,  costly,  and  harmful  to  our  reputation,  and  could  require  significant  amounts  of  management  time  and  corporate  resources.  If  any  of  these  legalproceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced tochange the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In  addition,  we  regularly  include  arbitration  provisions  in  our  terms  of  service  with  end-users.  These  provisions  are  intended  to  streamline  the  litigationprocess for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration maybecome more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certainrisks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may inthe future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increaseour  litigation  costs  and  exposure  in  respect  of  such  proceedings.  For  example,  effective  May  15,  2018,  we  ended  mandatory  arbitration  of  sexual  misconductclaims by platform users and employees.Further,  with  the  potential  for  conflicting  rules  regarding  the  scope  and  enforceability  of  arbitration  on  a  state-by-state  basis,  as  well  as  conflicting  rulesbetween state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories ofprotection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, wecould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costlylawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.40 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the name of the law that requires companies to disclose personal data to government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the name of the law that requires companies to disclose personal data to government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies", "answer": "I do not know"}

We are subject to the FCPAand other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political partiesfor the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject toadditional  compliance  requirements  to  identify  criminal  activity  and  payments  to  sanctioned  parties.  Our  activities  in  certain  countries  with  high  levels  ofcorruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, orbusiness  partners  in  violation  of  various  anti-corruption  laws,  including  the  FCPA, even  though  the  actions  of  these  parties  are  often  outside  our  control.  Ouracquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not befamiliar  with,  and  may  not  have  been  previously  subject  to,  these  anti-corruption  laws.  In  addition,  our  existing  and  future  safeguards,  including  training  andcompliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be heldresponsible.  Additional  compliance  requirements  may  compel  us  to  revise  or  expand  our  compliance  program,  including  the  procedures  we  use  to  verify  theidentity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using ourplatform.Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial  taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions inwhich we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacificregion, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to belicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Driversmay  adversely  affect  our ability  to scale  our business  and operations.  In addition,  it  is possible that  various  jurisdictions  could  impose caps  on the number  oflicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulationsthat were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers becomesubject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attractDrivers  may  be  challenged  by  competitors,  government  regulators,  or  individual  plaintiffs.  For  example,  putative  class  actions  have  been  filed  by  individualplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messagesfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. Inconnection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming todefend,  and,  if  resolved  adversely  to  us,  could  result  in  material  financial  damages  and  penalties,  costly  adjustments  to  our  business  practices,  and  negativepublicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging thesepractices.Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurancecarriers  change  the  terms  of  such  insurance  in  a  manner  not  favorable  to  Drivers  or  to  us,  if  we  are  required  to  purchase  additional  insurance  for  otheraspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related toour Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motoristcoverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on alimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannotguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain otherautomobile  insurance  coverage  for  owned  vehicles  and  employee  activity,  as  well  as  insurance  coverage  for  non-automotive  corporate  risks  including  generalliability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a mannerunfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States andCanada than in other geographies.

Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustmentexpenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates,historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of ourreserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have asignificant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers whouse  our  platform,  even  when  those  Drivers  are  not  actively  using  our  platform  or  when  an  individual  impersonates  a  Driver.  As  we  expand  to  include  moreofferings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and generalliability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that areclaimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face.

Further, we may be unable to detectinfringement  of  our  intellectual  property  rights,  and  even  if  we  detect  such  violations  and  decide  to  enforce  our  intellectual  property  rights,  we  may  not  besuccessful, and may incur significant expenses, in such efforts. In addition, any such enforcement efforts may be time-consuming and may divert management’sattention. Further, such enforcement efforts may result in a ruling that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable or invalid. Any failure to protect or anyloss of our intellectual property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operatingresults.Companies  in  the  Internet  and  technology  industries,  and  other  patent  and  trademark  holders,  including  “non-practicing  entities,”  seeking  to  profit  fromroyalties  in  connection  with  grants  of  licenses  or  seeking  to  obtain  injunctions,  own  large  numbers  of  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks,  and  trade  secrets  andfrequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have and may in the future continue toreceive notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed upon other parties’ intellectual property rights.Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas in which we historically have not operated, which could increaseour exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims. In addition, we, and companies we acquired or in which we have an interest, have been sued, and mayin the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual property infringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation. If a company we acquire or in which we havean interest loses rights to valuable intellectual property or is found to infringe third party intellectual property rights in such lawsuits, the value of our investmentmay materially decline.Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could divert our management’sattention and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated with our brand. These claims may also subject us to significant liability for damages and mayresult in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party’s rights. Further, certain adverseoutcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.We  may  be  required  or  may  opt  to  seek  a  license  for  the  right  to  use  intellectual  property  held  by  others,  which  may  not  be  available  on  commerciallyreasonable  terms,  or  at  all.  Even  if  a  license  is  available,  we  may  be  required  to  pay  significant  royalties  or  license  fees,  which  may  increase  our  operatingexpenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effortand  expense  and  make  us  less  competitive.  If  we  cannot  license  or  develop  alternative  technology,  content,  branding,  or  business  methods  for  any  allegedlyinfringing aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any ofthese results could harm our operating results.Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles.The accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our businessmodel,  interpretations  of  relevant  accounting  principles,  enforcement  of  existing  or  new  regulations,  and  changes  in  SEC  or  other  agency  policies,  rules,regulations,  and  interpretations,  of  accounting  regulations.  Changes  to  our  business  model  and  accounting  methods  could  result  in  changes  to  our  financialstatements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result inmaterially  different  financial  results,  and  may  require  that  we  change  how  we  process,  analyze,  and  report  financial  information  and  our  financial  reportingcontrols.If we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business.The Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which “investment companies” are permitted to conducttheir business activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an “investment company” underthe Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constituteinvestments in non-controlled entities (including in China), referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned affiliates, we believe thatwe are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed aninvestment  company,  such  a  determination  would  require  us  to  initiate  burdensome  compliance  requirements  and  comply  with  restrictions  imposed  by  theInvestment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would havean adverse effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to therequirements of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assetsand pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance,and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all orpart of your investment.43 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the potential consequence if the company is unable to license or develop alternative technology, content, branding, or business methods for allegedly infringing aspects of its business?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the potential consequence if the company is unable to license or develop alternative technology, content, branding, or business methods for allegedly infringing aspects of its business", "answer": "We may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions"}

Various  governmental  restrictions,  including  the  declaration  of  a  federal  National  Emergency,  multiple  cities’  and  states’declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measureshave, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides.Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to beimpacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 Response InitiativesWe continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve and continue to believewe will play an important role in the economic recovery of cities around the globe. We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 throughpreserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The pandemic hasreduced the demand for our Mobility offering globally, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic bylaunching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.To comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared rides Mobility offering inmost markets, and implemented “leave at door” delivery options for Delivery offerings. Additionally, we have asked that all employees who are able to do so, towork remotely.As  vaccination  rates  increase  in  the  United  States,  we  are  observing  that  consumer  demand  for  Mobility  is  recovering  faster  than  driver  availability,  andconsumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed Courier availability. During the first half of 2021, we announced that we are increasing investments in driverincentives to improve driver availability in the near-term.While we continue to assess the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately  predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business,results of operations, financial position, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, any futurewaves or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additionalactions  that  may  be  taken  by  governmental  authorities,  the  further  impact  on  the  business  of  Drivers,  Merchants,  consumers,  and  business  partners,  and  otherfactors identified in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Driver Classification DevelopmentsThe  classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.

Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San FranciscoSuperior Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the allegedcompetitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that useplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’spreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date ofProposition 22.In January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,which was denied.

The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our appwas switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majoritydecision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On  February  19,  2021,  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  UK upheld  the  tribunal  ruling.  Subsequently,  we  initiated  a  historical  claims  settlement  process  for  UKdrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the “worker” classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. The pension regulator hasconfirmed  that  Uber  will  be  required  to  pay  historic  company  contributions,  but  that  we  are  not  required  to  pay  the  driver  component  of  historic  pensioncontributions  unless  we  fail  to  comply  in  which  case  the  amount  equivalent  to  those  contributions  would  be  payable  as  a  penalty.  We  have  completed  theenrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our  portal  for  drivers  to  register  for  a  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  haveextended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.We are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers. Compensation hearings willtake place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands court ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, wewould  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (includingminimum  wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potentialpenalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,and  we  may  not  be  able  to  hire  a  majority  of  the  Drivers  currently  using  our  platform.

The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our appwas switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majoritydecision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On  February  19,  2021,  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  UK upheld  the  tribunal  ruling.  Subsequently,  we  initiated  a  historical  claims  settlement  process  for  UKdrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the “worker” classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. The pension regulator hasconfirmed  that  Uber  will  be  required  to  pay  historic  company  contributions,  but  that  we  are  not  required  to  pay  the  driver  component  of  historic  pensioncontributions  unless  we  fail  to  comply  in  which  case  the  amount  equivalent  to  those  contributions  would  be  payable  as  a  penalty.  We  have  completed  theenrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our  portal  for  drivers  to  register  for  a  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  haveextended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.We are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers. Compensation hearings willtake place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands court ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, wewould  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (includingminimum  wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potentialpenalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,and  we  may  not  be  able  to  hire  a  majority  of  the  Drivers  currently  using  our  platform.  Any  of  these  events  could  negatively  impact  our  business,  result  ofoperations, financial position, and cash flows.For a discussion of risk factors related  to how misclassification  challenges  may impact our business, result of operations, financial  position and operatingcondition  and  cash  flows,  see  the  risk  factor  titled  “-Our  business  would  be  adversely  affected  if  Drivers  were  classified  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in PartII, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In  addition,  if  we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  this  may  impact  our  current  financial  statement  presentation  including  revenue,  cost  ofrevenue, incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to theconsolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Part  II,  Item  8,  “Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,”  and  the  section  titled  “Critical  AccountingEstimates” in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.50 \n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the date when the portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "question": "What is the date when the portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed", "answer": "July 22, 2021"}
