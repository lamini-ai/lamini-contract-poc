(“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence andproduct\n expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings onour\n platform  (“platform(s)”  or  “Platform(s)”).  We  connect  consumers  (“Rider(s)”)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (“Mobility  Driver(s)”)  forridesharing\n services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (“Eater(s)”)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  “Merchants”)  with  deliveryservice\n providers  (“Couriers”)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.  Riders  and  Eaters  are  collectively  referred  to  as  “end-user(s)”  or“consumer(s).”\n Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We usethis same network, technology, ope\nrational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our\n technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (\nexcluding China and Southeast Asia).Our Segments\nAs\n of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fr\nagmented markets.Mobility\nMobility\n refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis. Mobility \nalso includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We\n believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory\n position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal\n ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven\n region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics\n firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe\n world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved\n based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category po\nsition in its respective market.Delivery\nOur\n Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered\n and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour\n Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables\n Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe\n pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform. In addition to b\nenefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve\n generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\nDuring\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (“Cornershop”) in an all-stock transaction. Theacquisition\n was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The DrizlyGroup,\n Inc.  (“Drizly”),  allowing  us to expand alcohol  offerings  in our Delivery  business  with Drizly’s  leading  platform,  technology,  scale,  and expertise.  Theacquisition\n of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination.

Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automateand\n accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nthrough its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,traditional employm\nent. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain availableto anyone who chooses platform-bas\ned work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible,\n flexible,  independent  work  has  offered  an  option  for  many  workers  historically  marginalized  from  the  labor  market  and  has  enabled  widegeographic\n coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using anapp to connect with work opportuniti\nes. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generallypatchy\n compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker iseither\n an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. AtUber,\n we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovativeways to address these issues.\n•\nAdvocacy:  We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all workshould\n be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber—and otherapp\n based companies—to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples ofour advocacy to preserve f\nlexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:◦\nIn  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  onpolicymakers,\n platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work—one where having accessto protections and benefi\nts doesn’t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.◦\nIn California, we welcomed  the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements  for platform companies  like Uber to providebenefits, including heal\nthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.◦\nIn the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant tothis\n change, drivers who use Uber’s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paidholiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also annou\nnced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an evenstronger voice to drivers \nand to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.•\nProtections  and benefits:  We  partner  with  leading  insurance  companies  around  the  world  to  pioneer  protections  for  independent  workers,  includingimplementing addition\nal protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.•\nEarnings:  We  are  continually  developing  new  technology  that  Drivers  can  use  to  acquire  information  that  may  help  them  save  on  costs  and  makeinformed choices about wher\ne and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).•\nProgression:  We  have  partnered  with  Arizona  State  University  to  offer  eligible  Drivers  and  their  family  members  access  to  over  100  undergraduatedegree\n programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship. Through our partnership with Arizona State University, over4,000 Drivers and their fami\nly members have enrolled in an undergraduate degree program.•\nEngagement:  We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform. We believe thatthe\n best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Driversto participate\n in meaningful dialogue with us. In markets across the world, we hold regular meetings with Driver associations and conduct regular surveysto gather feedback on our app, ou\nr support services, and other matters.For\n additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers, whether\n as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adverselyimpacted.”\n included  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  as  well  our  2021  ESG  Report  and  our  2021  People  and  Culture  Report.

The  acquisition  of  Transplace  has  been  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination.  For  additionalinformation, see Note\n 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPlatform Synergies\nOur Platform\nThe\n foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise. Together, these elements powermovement from point A to point B.\nMassive Network\nOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers,\n as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip.In\n approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of abutton for millions, and we hope ev\nentually billions, of people.Leading Technology\nWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of ourdeep\n technology  advantage  and  include  demand  prediction,  matching  and  dispatching,  and  pricing  technologies.  Ourtechnologies make it ex\ntremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational Excellence\nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scaleproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\ncities and regulators.\nProduct Expertise\nOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provideplatform\n users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety andtrust.\nWe intend to continue to inv\nest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We\n believe  that  all  of  these  synergies  serve  the  customer  experience,  enabling  us  to  attract  new  platform  users  and  to  deepen  engagement  with  existingplatform\n users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example,Delivery\n attracts new consumers to our network—for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to ourplatform.\n Additionally,  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  consumers  who  used  both  Mobility  and  Delivery  generated  12.6  Trips  per  month  onaverage,\n compared  to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering  in cities where both Mobility  and Delivery were offered. Webelieve that these t\nrends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With\n our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the UnitedStates as our single cross-pl\natform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priorityservice,\n and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available inselect cities\n as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for ourconsumers. We exited\n 2021 with over 6 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs. In 2020, we rolled out our“Super App” view on iOS and Android, which combines our mul\ntiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers.We\n are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlockingcross-platform adver\ntising formats. During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000.Competitive Environment\nWe\n compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and inthe\n logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competitionfrom new market entrants \ngiven the low barriers to entry that characterize5\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the number of active advertising merchants in the fourth quarter of 2021?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the number of active advertising merchants in the fourth quarter of 2021?", "answer": "over 170,000"}

While\n we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona\n limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan we do. The competition we fa\nce in each of our offerings includes:•\nMobility.  Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the marketsthat\n we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,public\n transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.We\n also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint ventu\nre.•\nDelivery.

These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,background checks, vehicle insp\nections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.In\n addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California’s AssemblyBill\n 5  (“AB5”),  which  went  into  effect  in  January  2020,  codified  a  test  to  determine  whether  a  worker  is  an  employee  under  California  law.  The  CaliforniaAttorney\n General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\n and sought  an injunction  and  monetary  damages  related  to  the  alleged  competitive  advantage  caused  by  the  alleged  misclassification  of  drivers.Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enj\noining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,the\n parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021.

Our  prior  failure  to  prioritize  compliance,  has  led  to  increased  regulatory  scrutinyglobally.\n Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment topromote\n transparency  and  collaboration,  regulators  may  continue  to  perceive  us  negatively,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial  condition,operating results, and prospe\ncts.Our historical\n workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing,causing misalignment and inefficiencies\n in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these effortsmay\n not be successful. Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated ormanaged\n to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions. Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, suchreorganizations may not b\ne successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our company.Our workforce and\n operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020. If weare\n unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and futureprospects will be adversely af\nfected.Since\n our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business andhas\n placed,  and  will  continue  to  place,  significant  strain  on  our  management,  personnel,  operations,  systems,  technical  performance,  financial  resources,  andinternal\n financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affectour operating results.\nAs\n our  operations  have  expanded,  we  have  grown  from  159  employees  as  of  December  31,  2012  to  approximately  29,300  global  employees  as  ofDecember\n 31, 2021, of whom approximately 12,300 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside theUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Pr\noperly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,including\n engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our newhires\n perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining ourexisting employees and\n staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions inworkforce\n and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductionsin\n workforce.  Any  reduction  in  workforce  or  restructuring  may  yield  unintended  consequences  and  costs,  such  as  attrition  beyond  the  intended  reduction  inworkforce, the\n distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficultfor\n us  to  hire  new  employees  in  the  future  and  increase  the  risk  that  we  may  not  achieve  the  anticipated  benefits  from  the  reduction  in  workforce.  Properlymanaging\n our growth or any reductions  in workforce  will  require  us to establish  consistent  policies  across regions  and functions,  and a failure  to do so couldlikewise harm our business.\nOur\n failure  to  upgrade  our  technology  or  network  infrastructure  effectively  to  support  our  growth  could  result  in  unanticipated  system  disruptions,  slowresponse times,\n or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improvethe\n technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controlsover\n financial  reporting,  we  will  be  required  to  commit  substantial  financial,  operational,  and  technical  resources.  In  particular,  we  will  need  to  improve  ourtransaction\n processing  and  reporting,  operational,  and  financial  systems,  procedures,  and  controls.  For  example,  due  to  our  significant  growth,  especially  withrespect to\n our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolvingrisks\n of material misstatement.

On a smaller scale, wemay\n face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. Inaddition, the\n growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable roadusers\n and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved oruneven\n roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitanareas, need\n to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” hours,all of which heighten the potential risk\n of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which weare\n exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase ouroperating\n costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significantcosts in investigating and de\nfending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may\n increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherentlyrisky, and we may never realize any expec\nted benefits from them.We have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologie\ns, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing newtechnologies, tools,\n features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in severalcountries including\n Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,which operates an\n on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. We also plan to invest significantresources\n to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our developmentbudget\n efficiently  or  effectively  on  commercially  successful  and  innovative  technologies,  we  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits  of  our  strategy.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\n•difficulties  in  implementing  and  maintaining  the  financial  systems  and  processes  needed  to  enable  compliance  across  multiple  offerings  andjurisdictions;\n•\nimport and export restr ictions and changes in trade regulation;•\npolitical,  social, and economic instability abroad, war, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general, and societal crime conditions that harm ordisrupt the global economy and\n/or can directly impact platform users;•\npublic  health concerns or emergencies,  such as the current COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable  diseases  or viruses, outbreaks ofwhich have from time to t\nime occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate; and•\nreduced or varied protectio n for intellectual property rights in some markets.These risks could adversely a\nffect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We have limited influence ov\ner our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.Our\n growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering withand\n investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategyhas\n also  included  the  divestment  of  certain  lines  of  businesses  in  its  entirety,  and  not  just  in  certain  jurisdictions,  and  instead  partnering  and  investing  in  ourcompetitors\n in  those  lines  of  businesses.  As  a  result,  a  significant  portion  of  our  assets  includes  minority  ownership  positions,  including  in  Didi,  Grab,  ourYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lim\ne, Zomato and Aurora.Our ownership\n in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors ofDidi\n or Zomato, and therefore we do not participate in the day-to-day management of Didi or Zomato or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi andZomato.\n We are not represented on the management teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day\n management  of  Grab,  our  Yandex.Taxi  joint  venture,  Lime  or  Aurora.  Although  we  are  represented  on  each  of  the  boards  of  directors  of  Grab,  ourYandex.Taxi\n joint venture, Lime and Aurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams ofthese\n companies  may  make  decisions  or  take  actions  with  which  we  disagree  or  that  may  be  harmful  to  the  value  of  our  ownership  in  these  companies.Additionally, these\n companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in variousmarkets throughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our owner\nship interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results,and prospects would be adversely a\nffected by such expansion into markets in which we operate.Any\n material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of theseassets\n is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affectsuch\n valuations.  To the extent  these businesses are or become publicly traded  companies, volatility  or fluctuations  in the stock price of such companies couldadversely\n impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companieshave\n limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limitedpublic information\n is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particulareconomic,\n tax,  political,  legal,  safety,  regulatory  and  public  health  risks,  including  the  extent  of  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  on  their  business;  aredomiciled\n or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and effortsof a small group of individuals, and, as a\n result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect onthe\n relevant company’s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitivepositions.\n Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operatingresults, or the trading pr\nice of our common stock.Further,\n we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora’s November 2021 initial publicoffering, we\n are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Other than Aurora, Grab, Didi and Zomato, there is currently no public market forany of these securities, and there may be no market\n in the future if and when we decide to sell such assets. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at atime\n at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment companyunder\n the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we wouldnot\n be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets.Accordingly, we may never rea\nlize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.We\n may  experience  significant  fluctuations  in  our operating  results.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nexpressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority ofthese\n Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, we areinvolved\n in  numerous  legal  proceedings  regarding  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements  entered  into  with  Drivers.  If  we  are  not  successful  in  suchproceedings,\n this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on ourbusiness and financial condi\ntion.Changes\n to  foreign,  state,  and  local  laws  governing  the  definition  or  classification  of  independent  contractors,  or  judicial  decisions  regarding  independentcontractor\n classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers\n by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought\n litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral,\n in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\n and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. InAugust 2020,\n the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe\n pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court’s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the \ninjunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In\n November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours\n for independent  work. Proposition 22 went into  effect  in December  2020 and we expect  that Drivers  will  be able  to maintain  their  status as independentcontractors\n under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminar\ny injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the ef\nfective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We\n face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging\n that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay\n be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,\n we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated\n with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity\n contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however,\n we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not haveadequate\n Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof\n the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effec\nt on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another\n example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.  Uber  B.V.,  et  al.  ruling  by  theEmployment\n Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan\n self-employed).  Subsequent  to the  UK Supreme  Court’s  ruling,  we announced  that  we will  treat  all  UK drivers  as “workers”  under  UK labor  law, goingforward.\n Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday\n pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relatio\nnship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme\n Court  that  reclassified  an  UberX  Driver  as  an  employee  (which  has  been  followed  by  inconsistent  appellate  decisions  regarding  employee  status),decisions\n by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish\n regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the mea\nning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In\n addition,  reclassification  of  Drivers  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist,  have  and  could  lead  to  groups  of  Driversbecoming\n represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number ofDrivers\n were  to  become  unionized  and  collective  bargaining  agreement  terms  were  to  deviate  significantly  from  our  business  model,  our  business,  financialcondition,\n operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disruptour operations and reduce our n\net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.In\n addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentationincluding\n revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “CriticalAccounting\n Estimates”  included  in  Part  II,  Item  7  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  and  Note  1  in  the  section  titled  “Notes  to  the  Consolidated  FinancialStatements” included in Pa\nrt II, Item 8 of this Annual Report14\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the total amount paid by Uber to resolve classification claims of a majority of drivers under individual settlement agreements?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the total amount paid by Uber to resolve classification claims of a majority of drivers under individual settlement agreements", "answer": "approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021"}

For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral,\n in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\n and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. InAugust 2020,\n the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe\n pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court’s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the \ninjunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In\n November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours\n for independent  work. Proposition 22 went into  effect  in December  2020 and we expect  that Drivers  will  be able  to maintain  their  status as independentcontractors\n under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminar\ny injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the ef\nfective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We\n face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging\n that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay\n be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,\n we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated\n with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity\n contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however,\n we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not haveadequate\n Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof\n the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effec\nt on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another\n example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.  Uber  B.V.,  et  al.  ruling  by  theEmployment\n Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan\n self-employed).  Subsequent  to the  UK Supreme  Court’s  ruling,  we announced  that  we will  treat  all  UK drivers  as “workers”  under  UK labor  law, goingforward.\n Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday\n pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relatio\nnship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme\n Court  that  reclassified  an  UberX  Driver  as  an  employee  (which  has  been  followed  by  inconsistent  appellate  decisions  regarding  employee  status),decisions\n by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish\n regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the mea\nning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In\n addition,  reclassification  of  Drivers  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist,  have  and  could  lead  to  groups  of  Driversbecoming\n represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number ofDrivers\n were  to  become  unionized  and  collective  bargaining  agreement  terms  were  to  deviate  significantly  from  our  business  model,  our  business,  financialcondition,\n operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disruptour operations and reduce our n\net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.In\n addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentationincluding\n revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “CriticalAccounting\n Estimates”  included  in  Part  II,  Item  7  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  and  Note  1  in  the  section  titled  “Notes  to  the  Consolidated  FinancialStatements” included in Pa\nrt II, Item 8 of this Annual Report14\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the potential impact on Uber's business and financial condition if the company is not successful in legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements with drivers?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the potential impact on Uber's business and financial condition if the company is not successful in legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements with drivers?", "answer": "If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition"}

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nthe United States, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, atleast in the near term.\nIf\n we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform will become \nless appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.Our\n success  in  a  given  geographic  market  significantly  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  or  increase  our  network  scale  and  liquidity  in  that  geographicmarket\n by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, orelect\n to offer them through a competitor’s  platform, we may lack a sufficient  supply of Drivers to attract  consumers  and merchants  to our platform.  We haveexperienced and expect \nto continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have beenand may continue to\n be impacted by concerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a givenmarket,\n we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network effect that weexperience in that\n market. Similarly, if carriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficientsupply\n of carriers in specific geographic markets to attract shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in aspecific\n geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, wemay\n lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offeringwill\n become less appealing to consumers and merchants. A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurantgroups\n and  other  merchants,  and  this  concentration  increases  the  risk  of  fluctuations  in  our  operating  results  and  our  sensitivity  to  any  material  adversedevelopments experienced by our significant restaurant partners.\n If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lacksufficient\n opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of ourplatform.\n An insufficient supply of platform users would decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we maybenefit\n from having larger network scale and liquidity than some competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcomeby\n smaller competitors. Maintaining a balance between supply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may bemore\n important  to  service  quality  than  the  absolute  size  of  the  network.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nAny decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm ourfuture operating results.\nIn addition, changes in\n Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers toour\n platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,prosecutors, taxicab owners, and cons\numers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to makedeliveries\n through  Delivery,  our  qualification  and  background  check  standards  are  generally  less  extensive  than  the  standards  for  Drivers  who  are  eligible  toprovide\n rides through our Mobility products.

Required  changes  in  the  qualification,  screening,  and  background  check  process  (including  anychanges\n to  such  processes  of  Careem,  Postmates  or  other  acquired  companies)  could  also  reduce  the  number  of  Drivers  in  those  markets  or  extend  the  timerequired\n to  recruit  new  Drivers  to  our  platform,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business  and  growth.

Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicit\ny could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future\n leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee\n turnover.

We \nmay not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.In addition, our failure \nto put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transitioninto new\n roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults.\n The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personneltransitions\n has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, andyears\n of industry experience.

Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existin\ng or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substant\nial fines or penalties.Our\n business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business.\nOur\n success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are\n often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace\n practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our\n employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our “return to office” plan,which\n includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintainin\ng our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability toattract\n employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remotework,\n as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand\n feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicit\ny could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future\n leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee\n turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives andemployees required for \nthe planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.In\n addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We haveentered\n into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our businessdifferently than me\nmbers of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,operations, or business plans. We \nmay not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.In addition, our failure \nto put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transitioninto new\n roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults.\n The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personneltransitions\n has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, andyears\n of industry experience. If we cannot effectively  manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future businessprospects could be adversely \naffected.To\n attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to attract and retain the personnelwe require to operate our bus\niness effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract,25\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the name of the company that has introduced a commercialized ride-hailing fleet of autonomous vehicles?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the name of the company that has introduced a commercialized ride-hailing fleet of autonomous vehicles?", "answer": "Waymo"}

Certain  of  our  existing  debtinstruments\n contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness andother\n financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, ourexisting\n debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financingon\n favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to supportour business growth and to respond to business ch\nallenges and competition may be significantly limited.We\n have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness maylimit the funds available to us, and the ter\nms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.As\n of December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount.

Subject  to  the  limitations  in  the  terms  of  ourexisting and future indebt\nedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may needto incur additional debt \nto finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.We\n may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments willreduce\n the funds available  to us for  working capital,  capital  expenditures,  and other  corporate  purposes and limit  our ability  to obtain  additional  financing  forworking\n capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten ourvulnerability\n to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business andthe\n industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cashflow\n from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness,or\n to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generatecash from operating ac\ntivities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.In\n addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations,including\n limitations  on  incurring  additional  indebtedness  and  liens,  limitations  on  certain  consolidations,  mergers,  and  sales  of  assets,  and  restrictions  on  thepayment\n of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raisingactivities\n and  other  financial  and  operational  matters,  which  may  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  obtain  additional  capital  to  pursue  business  opportunities,including\n potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit ourability to obtain addit\nional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.In addition, we are exposed to\n interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section titled “Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condit\nion and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.”We may have exposure to materiall\ny greater than anticipated tax liabilities.The\n tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different companies. For example, wemay\n become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we currently pay in those jurisdictions.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nnetwork. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomousvehicles\n present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired),\n Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey\n will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.  Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing\n fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous\n vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their tech\nnology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith\n which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould\n adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing,\n delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers\n on our platform. If a significant  number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our financial  performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.\nAutonomous vehicle technologies \ninvolve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicletechnologies\n that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liabilityfor\n us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,and operating results.\nFederal\n and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. Theseregulations\n could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,we\n may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existin\ng or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substant\nial fines or penalties.Our\n business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business.\nOur\n success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are\n often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace\n practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our\n employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our “return to office” plan,which\n includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintainin\ng our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability toattract\n employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remotework,\n as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand\n feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicit\ny could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future\n leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee\n turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives andemployees required for \nthe planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.In\n addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We haveentered\n into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our businessdifferently than me\nmbers of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,operations, or business plans. We \nmay not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.In addition, our failure \nto put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transitioninto new\n roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults.\n The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personneltransitions\n has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, andyears\n of industry experience. If we cannot effectively  manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future businessprospects could be adversely \naffected.To\n attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\ncode-sharing  website  used  by  software  developers  (the  “2014  Breach”).  In  October  and  November  of  2016,  outside  actors  downloaded  the  personal  data  ofapproximately\n 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the “2016 Breach”). The accessed data included the names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers,and drivers’ license numb\ners of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information on this incident, see the risk factors titled “—Wecurrently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and reque\nsts for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices, and other U.S. andforeign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which co\nuld harm our business” and “—We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, andother processing of data,\n which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy anddata\n protection  practices,”  below.  As  we  expand  our  operations,  we  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breaches  experienced  by  the  companies  we  acquire.  Forexample, in\n April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed accessto\n certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other datasecurity\n breaches,  or  if  we  fail  to  remediate  this  or  any  other  data  security  breach  that  Careem  or  we  experience,  we  may  face  harm  to  our  brand,  businessdisruption, and significant \nliabilities.If\n we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we mayfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operat\ning results would be adversely affected.To\n continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the developmentof new\n products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. Forexample, in\n January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider\n destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independenc\ne of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.Developing\n and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends\n on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any suchnew\n or  upgraded  products,  offerings,  or  features  may  not  work  as  intended  or  may  not  provide  intended  value  to  platform  users.  For  example,  some  productchanges\n in  California  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,  reduced  demand  for  rides  and  reduced  supply  of  Drivers  on  our  platform,  Driverdissatisfaction, and\n adverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, orif\n platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which wouldadversely affect our op\nerating results.We\n track  certain  operational  metrics  and  our  category  position  with  internal  systems  and  tools,  and  our  equity  stakes  in  minority-owned  affiliates  withinformation\n provided  by  such  minority-owned  affiliates,  and  do  not  independently  verify  such  metrics.  Certain  of  our  operational  metrics  are  subject  toinherent challenges in measurement, and real or perce\nived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.We\n track certain  operational  metrics, including key metrics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position, with internal systems andtools,\n and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, that are not independently verified by anythird\n party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions onwhich\n we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which couldresult\n in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose, or our estimates of our category position. If the internal systems and toolswe\n use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. Whilethese\n numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges inmeasuring\n how  our  products  are  used  across  large  populations  globally.  For  example,  we  believe  that  there  are  consumers  who  have  multiple  accounts,  eventhough\n we prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to howwe\n measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-termstrategies. If our operating metrics\n or our estimates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate representations ofour\n business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates of our category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates to beaccurate,\n or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial resultscould be adversely affected.\nIn\n certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, andsafety concerns. If we do not succes\nsfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or otheradverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and\n Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allowconsumers\n to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).In 2021, cash-paid trips accoun\nted for approximately 7% of our global27\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the number of personal data accessed in the 2016 Breach?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the number of personal data accessed in the 2016 Breach", "answer": "approximately 600,000 Drivers"}

Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financialposition\n and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment byour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertai\nn. The ultimate tax outcome may differ fromthe amounts\n recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.

The legislation and regulations promulgated in connection therewith remainunclear\n in  many  respects  and  could  be  subject  to  potential  amendments  and  technical  corrections,  as  well  as  interpretations  and  incremental  implementingregulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the\n “IRS”), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. Inaddition,\n it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting poi\nnt for computing state and local tax liabilities.We\n are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness.\n Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat\n we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stock\nholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.

If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January1,\n 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,we\n also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating losscarryforwards\n depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset futureincome\n tax  liabilities,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  In  addition,  under  Sections  382  and  383  of  the  IRC,  if  a  corporationundergoes\n an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’sability\n to use its pre-change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset itspost-change\n income  may  be  limited.

As a result of the large and expandingscale\n of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm ourfinancial position, oper\nating results, and cash flows.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other \ntax attributes may be limited.As\n of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and$12.4\n billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January1,\n 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,we\n also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating losscarryforwards\n depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset futureincome\n tax  liabilities,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  In  addition,  under  Sections  382  and  383  of  the  IRC,  if  a  corporationundergoes\n an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’sability\n to use its pre-change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset itspost-change\n income  may  be  limited.  Many  U.S. states  follow  similar  rules  for  restricting  use  of  tax  attributes  after  an  ownership  change.  We  may  experienceownership\n changes  in  the  future  because  of  subsequent  shifts  in  our  stock  ownership.  As  a  result,  if  we  earn  net  taxable  income,  our  ability  to  use  our  pre-ownership\n change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, whichcould potentially resul\nt in increased future tax liability to us.33\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the potential impact of changes in global and U.S. tax legislation on the company's financial condition, operating results, and cash flows?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the potential impact of changes in global and U.S. tax legislation on the company's financial condition, operating results, and cash flows?", "answer": "The potential impact of changes in global and U.S. tax legislation on the company's financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could increase the estimated tax liability that the company has expensed to date and paid or accrued on its balance sheet; affect its financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where it has operations; reduce post-tax returns to its stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance"}
{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nare made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collectingthe payment will be requi\nred to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.Additionally, the taxing autho\nrities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies forvaluing developed technology, whic\nh could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our futureincome\n taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions\n that  have  higher  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  allowance  on  our  U.S.  and  Netherlands'  deferred  tax  assets,  or  changes  in  tax  laws,regulations, or accounting p\nrinciples. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, andcurrently\n face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financialposition\n and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment byour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertai\nn. The ultimate tax outcome may differ fromthe amounts\n recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Ourtax\n positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future,which\n could  impact  our  financial  position.  In  addition,  in  connection  with  any  planned  or  future  acquisitions,  we  may  acquire  businesses  that  have  differinglicenses\n and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than ourlicenses\n and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certainjurisdictions\n or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financialstatements, and could adve\nrsely affect our financial results.Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely aff\nect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.We\n are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and modified in2020,\n has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and regulations promulgated in connection therewith remainunclear\n in  many  respects  and  could  be  subject  to  potential  amendments  and  technical  corrections,  as  well  as  interpretations  and  incremental  implementingregulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the\n “IRS”), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. Inaddition,\n it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting poi\nnt for computing state and local tax liabilities.We\n are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness.\n Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat\n we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stock\nholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potentialchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations\n, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We couldbecome\n subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate.

Suchviolations\n subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatoryentities\n in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been thesubject\n of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuantto\n which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how weprotect\n consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,future\n failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, U.K., Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately$1.6\n million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. In January 2016, we entered into a settlement with theOffice\n of the New York State Attorney General  under which we agreed  to enhance  our data security  practices.

The EU adopted the GDP\nR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers\n and processors of personal data.

Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significantadditional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive \ninsurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that41\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat are the anti-corruption laws that Uber is subject to?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What are the anti-corruption laws that Uber is subject to?", "answer": "The anti-corruption laws that Uber is subject to include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business"}
{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,investigations, and requests for information with respe\nct to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.We\n have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPAand\n other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political partiesfor the\n purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject toadditional\n compliance  requirements  to  identify  criminal  activity  and  payments  to  sanctioned  parties.  Our  activities  in  certain  countries  with  high  levels  ofcorruption\n enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, orbusiness\n partners  in  violation  of  various  anti-corruption  laws,  including  the  FCPA, even  though  the  actions  of  these  parties  are  often  outside  our  control.  Ouracquisition\n of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not befamiliar\n with,  and  may  not  have  been  previously  subject  to,  these  anti-corruption  laws.  In  addition,  our  existing  and  future  safeguards,  including  training  andcompliance\n programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be heldresponsible.\n Additional  compliance  requirements  may  compel  us  to  revise  or  expand  our  compliance  program,  including  the  procedures  we  use  to  verify  theidentity of platform users\n and monitor international and domestic transactions.Drivers\n may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using ourplatform.\nMany\n Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial  taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions inwhich\n we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacificregion,\n and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to belicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportati\non company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Driversmay\n adversely  affect  our ability  to scale  our business  and operations.  In addition,  it  is possible that  various  jurisdictions  could  impose caps  on the number  oflicensed\n Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulationsthat were\n adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers becomesubject to such caps, limi\ntations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.We may be subject to liabil\nity for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.We\n operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attractDrivers\n may  be  challenged  by  competitors,  government  regulators,  or  individual  plaintiffs.  For  example,  putative  class  actions  have  been  filed  by  individualplaintiffs\n against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messagesfrom us regarding our Driver p\nrogram without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,we\n settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. Inconnection with\n this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming todefend,\n and,  if  resolved  adversely  to  us,  could  result  in  material  financial  damages  and  penalties,  costly  adjustments  to  our  business  practices,  and  negativepublicity.\n In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging thesepractices.\nOur\n business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurancecarriers\n change  the  terms  of  such  insurance  in  a  manner  not  favorable  to  Drivers  or  to  us,  if  we  are  required  to  purchase  additional  insurance  for  otheraspects of our business, or if we fail to compl\ny with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.We\n use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related toour\n Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motoristcoverage.\n We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on alimited\n number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannotguarantee\n that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain otherautomobile\n insurance  coverage  for  owned  vehicles  and  employee  activity,  as  well  as  insurance  coverage  for  non-automotive  corporate  risks  including  generalliability,\n workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a mannerunfavorable\n to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States andCanada\n than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significantadditional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive \ninsurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that41\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat are the potential consequences if Uber fails to comply with anti-corruption laws?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What are the potential consequences if Uber fails to comply with anti-corruption laws?", "answer": "Our activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\ntransfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amountsthat\n may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustmentexpenses\n for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates,historical claim information, and industry data.\n While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of ourreserves.\n We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have asignificant impact on ou\nr unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.We\n may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers whouse\n our  platform,  even  when  those  Drivers  are  not  actively  using  our  platform  or  when  an  individual  impersonates  a  Driver.  As  we  expand  to  include  moreofferings\n on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and generalliability\n insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that areclaimed to\n have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims donot\n result  in  liability,  we  could  incur  significant  costs  in  investigating  and  defending  against  them.  If  insurers  become  insolvent,  they  may  not  be  able  to  payotherwise\n valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may besubject to negative publi\ncity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.In\n addition,  we  are  subject  to  local  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  relating  to  insurance  coverage  which  could  result  in  proceedings  or  actions  against  us  bygovernmental\n entities  or  others.  Legislation  has  been  passed  in  many  U.S.  jurisdictions  that  codifies  these  insurance  requirements  with  respect  to  ridesharing.Additional\n legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, serviceproviders\n and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts withus. Any failure, or perceived failure, by\n us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result inproceedings\n or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negativepublicity, require us to in\ncrease our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.We may be subject to pricing regulat\nions, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.Our revenue\n is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, havebeen,\n and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculateconsumer\n fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.Further,\n in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.Additional\n regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been thesubject\n of  litigation  and  regulatory  inquiries  related  to,  among  other  things,  the  calculation  of  and  statements  regarding  consumer  fares  and  Driver  earnings(including\n rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number ofmunicipalities\n have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As aresult, we may be forced to \nchange our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.If\n we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property ofothers, we may incur significant expense and our business may be advers\nely affected.Our\n intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardwaredesigns,\n registered  and  unregistered  trademarks,  trademark  applications,  copyrights,  trade  secrets,  inventions  (whether  or  not  patentable),  patents,  and  patentapplications.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nGross  Bookings.  This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.  The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  ourtechnology\n raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash forridesharing\n and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significantfines\n and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use ofcash\n with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent orfatal attacks, and other\n criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers whileusing\n our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which couldadversely impact our busin\ness.In\n addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue\n to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit thecash\n received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are notalways\n effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and wecannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Furt\nher, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect toa\n variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systemsfail,\n we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Suchcollection\n failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,impact our financial performance.\nLoss or material modification of our cr\nedit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by eithe\nr credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantlylimit\n our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry(“PCI”) and Data Security Standard\n (the “Standard”). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developedby the\n PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and othernetwork\n operating  rules could result  in fines or restrictions  on our ability  to accept payment  cards. Under certain circumstances  specified in the payment cardnetwork\n rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities mayreveal\n that  we  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  Standard.  If  an  audit,  self-  assessment,  or  other  test  determines  that  we  need  to  take  steps  to  remediate  anydeficiencies,\n such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,even if we comply with the Standa\nrd, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nGross  Bookings.  This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.  The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  ourtechnology\n raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash forridesharing\n and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significantfines\n and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use ofcash\n with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent orfatal attacks, and other\n criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers whileusing\n our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which couldadversely impact our busin\ness.In\n addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue\n to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips.

Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisitionand our brand and reputation cou\nld be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company’s brand.In\n addition,  our  acquisition  of  Careem  has  increased  our  risks  under  the  U.S. Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (“FCPA”)  and  other  similar  laws  outside  theUnited\n States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not proveeffective, and such par\nties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.We\n may not receive  a favorable  return  on investment  for  prior  or future  business  combinations,  and we cannot  predict  whether  these  transactions  will  beaccretive\n to  the  value  of  our  common  stock.  It  is  also  possible  that  acquisitions,  combinations,  divestitures,  joint  ventures,  or  other  strategic  transactions  weannounce\n could  be  viewed  negatively  by  the  press,  investors,  platform  users,  or  regulators,  any  or  all  of  which  may  adversely  affect  our  reputation  and  ourbusiness. Any of these factors may \nadversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe may continue to be blocked from or l\nimited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify ourbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.\nIn\n certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model hasbeen\n blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in suchjurisdictions.\n In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk\n revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going\n basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,”including with\n respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt\n granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person. Two new conditions(which\n we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Anyinability\n to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,\n and  operating  results.  We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities\n to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019, MexicoCity’s\n Secretaría  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  aprohibition\n on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  arequirement that Driv\ners in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection,we\n have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such \nregulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab \nand car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto\n comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019,\n we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked\n up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented\n a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew\n York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave\n had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted\n to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle\n licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust\n 2019, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new “cruisingcap,”\n intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although\n such “cruising cap” was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measur\ne to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton\n January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. Inaddition,\n in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1,\n 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate\n for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted incountries outside the United St\nates.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\njurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.In certain\n jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or thatwe\n believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations\n altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness\n operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers whoused\n the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges\n and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial\n performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat\n we  violated  local  competition  laws.  In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in\n Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain\n of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings\n or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision tocontinue\n operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of thispractice\n and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses\n or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue\n to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decisionas\n a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers’  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore,\n such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely\n affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave\n favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications. In\n addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing\n with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate inaccordance with our\n business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required tocomply with regulatory and oth\ner requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an advers\ne impact on our business and future prospects.As\n of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.  We  are  subject  to  differing,  andsometimes conflict\ning, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national,regional,\n and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our businessmodel.\n Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting howwe\n operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may beadopted.\nFurther,\n existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws andregulations,\n and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency  medicaltransportation, we\n may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market\n in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit\n or block our ability  to offer  our products to Drivers and consumers  in those jurisdictions,  thereby impeding overall  use of our platform. We are activelychallenging\n some  of  these  laws  and  regulations  and  are  lobbying  other  jurisdictions  to  oppose  similar  restrictions  on  our  business,  especially  our  ridesharingservices. Further,\n because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or\n emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London’s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for\n polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an “Ultra Low Emissions Zone” that went into effectin April\n 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto\n electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California tohave\n been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require usto share\n certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordancewith\n these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt oneither a temporary o\nr indefinite basis.Additionally, effectiv\ne January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (“EU”), an event commonly36\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat are the jurisdictions that impose similar regulations on the company?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What are the jurisdictions that impose similar regulations on the company", "answer": "I do not know"}

In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in\n Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain\n of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings\n or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision tocontinue\n operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of thispractice\n and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses\n or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue\n to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decisionas\n a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers’  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore,\n such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely\n affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave\n favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications. In\n addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing\n with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate inaccordance with our\n business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required tocomply with regulatory and oth\ner requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an advers\ne impact on our business and future prospects.As\n of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.  We  are  subject  to  differing,  andsometimes conflict\ning, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national,regional,\n and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our businessmodel.\n Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting howwe\n operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may beadopted.\nFurther,\n existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws andregulations,\n and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency  medicaltransportation, we\n may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market\n in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit\n or block our ability  to offer  our products to Drivers and consumers  in those jurisdictions,  thereby impeding overall  use of our platform. We are activelychallenging\n some  of  these  laws  and  regulations  and  are  lobbying  other  jurisdictions  to  oppose  similar  restrictions  on  our  business,  especially  our  ridesharingservices. Further,\n because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or\n emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London’s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for\n polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an “Ultra Low Emissions Zone” that went into effectin April\n 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto\n electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California tohave\n been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require usto share\n certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordancewith\n these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt oneither a temporary o\nr indefinite basis.Additionally, effectiv\ne January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (“EU”), an event commonly36\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat are the potential consequences of not complying with regulations in certain jurisdictions?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What are the potential consequences of not complying with regulations in certain jurisdictions?", "answer": "If the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'."}

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nreferred to as Brexit. The UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.In\n addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe\n application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers,\n including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto,\n among  other  things,  transportation,  competition,  advertising,  consumer  protection,  fee  calculations,  personal  injuries,  privacy,  intellectual  property,  productliability,\n discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the SupremeCourt of\n Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regionsof\n Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegatio\nns, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial\n damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould\n harm our ability  to operate  our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions  in which we operate,  which could adversely  affect  our business,revenue, and operating resu\nlts.In\n addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters throug\nh our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery\n and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan\n that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app coul\nd result in negativepublicity, market withdr\nawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competit\nion laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition\n authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, incl\nuding governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues\n of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof\n anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices aretoo\n high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour\n business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.  Further,  any  new  requirements  or  restrictions,  or  proposed  requirements  or  restrictions,  could  result  in  adversepublicity or fines, whether o\nr not valid or subject to appeal.In\n addition,  governmental  agencies  and  regulators  may,  among  other  things,  prohibit  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  or  combinations  we  plan  to  make,impose\n significant  fines  or penalties,  require  divestiture  of  certain  of our  assets,  or impose  other  restrictions  that  limit  or require  us to modify  our operations,including\n limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we dobusiness\n and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financialcondition, or operating resu\nlts.We\n expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focuson\n the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of aninvestigation\n or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limitour future acquisitions, div\nestitures, operations and growth.Our business is subject to extensive government regula\ntion and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.Most\n jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine thatcertain\n aspects  of  our  business  are  subject  to  these  laws  and  could  require  us  to  obtain  licenses  to  continue  to  operate  in  such  jurisdictions.  For  example,  oursubsidiary\n in  the  Netherlands,  Uber  Payments  B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  by  its  competent  authority,  De  Nederlandsche  Bank,  as  an  electronic  moneyinstitution.\n This  authorization  permits  Uber  Payments  B.V.  to  provide  payment  services  (including  acquiring  and  executing  payment  transactions  and  moneyremittances,\n as  referred  to  in  the  Revised  Payment  Services  Directive  (2015/2366/EU))  and  to  issue  electronic  money  in  the  Netherlands.  In  addition,  UberPayments\n B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. Wecontinue to critically evaluate\n our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and supportthe\n future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our businessoperations\n before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease orlimit business\n37\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat percentage of the company's global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021 was the UK?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What percentage of the company's global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021 was the UK", "answer": "8.3"}

As such, even if we are able to identify atarget\n for  acquisition,  we  may  not  be  able  to  complete  the  acquisition  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  we  may  not  be  able  to  receive  approval  from  theapplicable competi\ntion authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.Further,\n negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.We\n may  expend  significant  cash  or  incur  substantial  debt  to  finance  such  acquisitions,  and  such  indebtedness  may  restrict  our  business  or  require  the  use  ofavailable\n cash  to  make  interest  and  principal  payments.  In  addition,  we  may  finance  or  otherwise  complete  acquisitions  by  issuing  equity  or  convertible  debtsecurities,\n which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluateand\n execute  acquisitions  or  other  strategic  transactions  successfully  or  fail  to  successfully  address  any  of  these  risks,  our  business,  financial  condition,  andoperating results may be h\narmed.In\n addition,  any  businesses  we  acquire  may  not  perform  as  well  as  we  expect.  Failure  to  manage  and  successfully  integrate  acquired  businesses  andtechnologies,\n including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results andexpansion\n prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policiesregarding\n data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, anddoing\n so  may  cause  our  relationships  with  government  authorities  in  certain  jurisdictions  to  suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessingsignificant\n fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. The process of integrating an acquiredcompany, business, or technology or a\ncquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:•\ndiverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;•\ndisrupting our ongoing business operat ions;•\nplatform user accep tance of the acquired company’s offerings;•\nimplementing or rem ediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;•\nintegrating the acqui red business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;•\nretaining  and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees, managing culturaldifferences\n between  acquired  businesses  and  our  business,  as  well  as  managing  costs  associated  with  eliminating  redundancies  or  transferringemployees on acceptabl\ne terms with minimal business disruption;•\nmaintaining importan t business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;•\nintegrating the brand id entity of an acquired company with our own;•\nintegrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;•\nliability for pre- acquisition activities of the acquired company;•\nlitigation or other c laims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and•\nimpairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.We have in the past and may \nin the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s operating functions. For example,with respect to the integ\nration of Careem and Drizly, each company’s brand, product app(s) and34\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat are some of the challenges associated with integrating an acquired company?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What are some of the challenges associated with integrating an acquired company?", "answer": "The challenges associated with integrating an acquired company include diverting management time and focus from operating the business to acquisition integration, disrupting ongoing business operations, platform user acceptance of the acquired company's offerings, implementing or remedying the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company, integrating the acquired business onto the company's systems and ensuring the acquired business meets financial reporting requirements and timelines, retaining and integrating acquired employees, maintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business, integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with the company's own, integrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where the company does not have prior experience, liability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired company, litigation or other claims or liabilities arising in"}

Any of these factors may \nadversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe may continue to be blocked from or l\nimited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify ourbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.\nIn\n certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model hasbeen\n blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in suchjurisdictions.\n In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk\n revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going\n basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,”including with\n respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt\n granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person. Two new conditions(which\n we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Anyinability\n to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,\n and  operating  results.  We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities\n to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019, MexicoCity’s\n Secretaría  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  aprohibition\n on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  arequirement that Driv\ners in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection,we\n have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such \nregulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab \nand car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto\n comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019,\n we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked\n up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented\n a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew\n York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave\n had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted\n to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle\n licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust\n 2019, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new “cruisingcap,”\n intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although\n such “cruising cap” was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measur\ne to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton\n January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nreferred to as Brexit. The UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.In\n addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe\n application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers,\n including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto,\n among  other  things,  transportation,  competition,  advertising,  consumer  protection,  fee  calculations,  personal  injuries,  privacy,  intellectual  property,  productliability,\n discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the SupremeCourt of\n Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regionsof\n Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegatio\nns, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial\n damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould\n harm our ability  to operate  our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions  in which we operate,  which could adversely  affect  our business,revenue, and operating resu\nlts.In\n addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters throug\nh our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery\n and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan\n that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app coul\nd result in negativepublicity, market withdr\nawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competit\nion laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition\n authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, incl\nuding governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues\n of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof\n anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices aretoo\n high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour\n business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.  Further,  any  new  requirements  or  restrictions,  or  proposed  requirements  or  restrictions,  could  result  in  adversepublicity or fines, whether o\nr not valid or subject to appeal.In\n addition,  governmental  agencies  and  regulators  may,  among  other  things,  prohibit  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  or  combinations  we  plan  to  make,impose\n significant  fines  or penalties,  require  divestiture  of  certain  of our  assets,  or impose  other  restrictions  that  limit  or require  us to modify  our operations,including\n limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we dobusiness\n and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financialcondition, or operating resu\nlts.We\n expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focuson\n the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of aninvestigation\n or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limitour future acquisitions, div\nestitures, operations and growth.Our business is subject to extensive government regula\ntion and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.Most\n jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine thatcertain\n aspects  of  our  business  are  subject  to  these  laws  and  could  require  us  to  obtain  licenses  to  continue  to  operate  in  such  jurisdictions.  For  example,  oursubsidiary\n in  the  Netherlands,  Uber  Payments  B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  by  its  competent  authority,  De  Nederlandsche  Bank,  as  an  electronic  moneyinstitution.\n This  authorization  permits  Uber  Payments  B.V.  to  provide  payment  services  (including  acquiring  and  executing  payment  transactions  and  moneyremittances,\n as  referred  to  in  the  Revised  Payment  Services  Directive  (2015/2366/EU))  and  to  issue  electronic  money  in  the  Netherlands.  In  addition,  UberPayments\n B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\noperations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action,or stripped\n of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed asa\n payment  services  provider.  Were  local  regulators  to  determine  that  such  arrangements  require  us  to  be  so  licensed,  such  regulators  may  block  payments  toDrivers,\n merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantialdelay in payments we make in \ncertain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users wit\nh payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong\n Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach\n payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform\n user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform\n or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and\n prospects.  Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting\n all  necessary  authentication  steps.  Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived\n by  those  users.  A  substantial  increase  in  the  frequency  with  which  we  make  Driver  payments  without  having  received  corresponding  payments  fromconsumers could adversely a\nffect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.In\n addition,  laws  related  to  money  transmission  and  online  payments  are  evolving,  and  changes  in  such  laws  could  affect  our  ability  to  provide  paymentprocessing\n on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith\n changes  to  the  EU  Payment  Services  Directive,  caused  aspects  of  our  payment  operations  in  the  EEA  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  European  paymentsregulation.\n As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering,\n terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. EffectiveJuly\n 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulat\nions.In\n addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission,\n online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic fundstransfers,\n anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and exportrestrictions.\n Our  business  operations,  including  our  payments  to  Drivers  and  merchants,  may  not  always  comply  with  these  financial  laws  and  regulations.Historical\n or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,or\n other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits onour ability to expand our produc\nt offerings, could harm our business.Further,\n our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,and\n payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money launderingand\n sanctions  laws,  and  in  the  EEA  to  conduct  appropriate  risk  assessments  and  implement  appropriate  controls  as  a  regulated  financial  service  provider.Government\n authorities  may  seek  to  bring  legal  action  against  us  if  our  payment  system  is  used  for  improper  or  illegal  purposes  or  if  our  enterprise  riskmanagement or\n controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to ourbusiness.\nWe\n currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices and otherU.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes o\nf which could harm our business.We\n are  the  subject  of  DOJ  criminal  and  civil  inquiries  and  investigations,  as  well  as  civil  enforcement  inquiries  and  investigations  by  other  governmentagencies,\n including state AG offices in the United States and abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our businesspractices,\n such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved thebreach\n of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future,settle\n claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with theAttorneys\n General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related toour\n failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach andthe\n 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December2018,\n U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately  $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and maycontinue\n to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially materialfines\n and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued aproposed\n $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US SafetyReport. We negotiated the \ntotal payment to $9.1538\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat are the potential consequences of not obtaining licenses to operate as a payment services provider in certain jurisdictions?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What are the potential consequences of not obtaining licenses to operate as a payment services provider in certain jurisdictions", "answer": "operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses.

For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith\n changes  to  the  EU  Payment  Services  Directive,  caused  aspects  of  our  payment  operations  in  the  EEA  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  European  paymentsregulation.\n As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering,\n terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. EffectiveJuly\n 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulat\nions.In\n addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission,\n online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic fundstransfers,\n anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and exportrestrictions.\n Our  business  operations,  including  our  payments  to  Drivers  and  merchants,  may  not  always  comply  with  these  financial  laws  and  regulations.Historical\n or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,or\n other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits onour ability to expand our produc\nt offerings, could harm our business.Further,\n our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,and\n payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money launderingand\n sanctions  laws,  and  in  the  EEA  to  conduct  appropriate  risk  assessments  and  implement  appropriate  controls  as  a  regulated  financial  service  provider.Government\n authorities  may  seek  to  bring  legal  action  against  us  if  our  payment  system  is  used  for  improper  or  illegal  purposes  or  if  our  enterprise  riskmanagement or\n controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to ourbusiness.\nWe\n currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices and otherU.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes o\nf which could harm our business.We\n are  the  subject  of  DOJ  criminal  and  civil  inquiries  and  investigations,  as  well  as  civil  enforcement  inquiries  and  investigations  by  other  governmentagencies,\n including state AG offices in the United States and abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our businesspractices,\n such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved thebreach\n of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future,settle\n claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with theAttorneys\n General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related toour\n failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach andthe\n 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December2018,\n U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately  $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and maycontinue\n to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially materialfines\n and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued aproposed\n $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US SafetyReport. We negotiated the \ntotal payment to $9.1538\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat are the potential consequences of not complying with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) regulatory requirements in the EEA?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What are the potential consequences of not complying with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) regulatory requirements in the EEA?", "answer": "If the platform user does not complete the necessary authentication steps, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated, and we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services received by those users.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\noperations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action,or stripped\n of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed asa\n payment  services  provider.  Were  local  regulators  to  determine  that  such  arrangements  require  us  to  be  so  licensed,  such  regulators  may  block  payments  toDrivers,\n merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantialdelay in payments we make in \ncertain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users wit\nh payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong\n Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach\n payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform\n user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform\n or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and\n prospects.  Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting\n all  necessary  authentication  steps.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nAustralia Class ActionIn\n May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf ofcertain\n participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during theperiod\n 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. Theclaim\n alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain\n taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We denythese allegations and in\ntend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.Other Legal Proceedings\nWhile\n it  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  outcome  of  the  legal  actions,  investigations,  and  proceedings  brought  against  us,  we  believe  that,  except  for  thematters\n described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could bematerial\n to  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  in  any  one  accounting  period.  We  are  currently  involved  in,  and  may  in  the  future  be  involved  in,  legalproceedings,\n litigation,  claims,  and  government  investigations  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  In  addition,  the  nature  of  our  business  exposes  us  to  claimsrelated\n to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the UnitedStates\n where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and governmentinvestigations\n in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have amaterial\n adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, andgovernment\n investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorablepreliminary and inte\nrim rulings.ITEM 4.

The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our appwas\n switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majoritydecision on December 19, 2018. We app\nealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On\n February  19,  2021,  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  UK upheld  the  tribunal  ruling.  Subsequently,  we  initiated  a  historical  claims  settlement  process  for  UKdrivers. Damages may includ\ne back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate act\nion to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the “worker” classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we annou\nnced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith\n Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proa\nctively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment impleme\nntation. The pension regulator hasconfirmed\n that  Uber  will  be  required  to  pay  historic  company  contributions,  but  that  we  are  not  required  to  pay  the  driver  component  of  historic  pensioncontributions\n unless  we  fail  to  comply  in  which  case  the  amount  equivalent  to  those  contributions  would  be  payable  as  a  penalty.  We  have  completed  theenrollment of eligib\nle drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our\n portal  for  drivers  to  register  for  a  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  haveextended offers to all d\nrivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.We\n are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers. Compensation hearings willtake place in 2022 for cl\naimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands \ncourt ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If,\n as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, wewould\n incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (includingminimum\n wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potentialpenalties.\n Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,and\n we  may  not  be  able  to  hire  a  majority  of  the  Drivers  currently  using  our  platform.

Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue and Take Rate resulting from an increase in certain Courier paymentsand incentives that ar\ne recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.Delivery\n adjusted  EBITDA  loss  improved,  primarily  attributable  to  an  increase  in  Delivery  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  $2.6  billion  increase  in  cost  ofrevenue as well as a $710 mil\nlion increase in consumer promotions, brand marketing, and employee headcount costs.Freight Segment\nFor\n the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Freight revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 111% and Freight adjustedEBITDA loss improved $97 million, or 43%.\nFreight\n revenue increased primarily attributable  to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the increase in Freight revenue isalso driven by the \ngrowth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in volumes with our top shippers.Freight\n adjusted EBITDA loss improved, primarily attributable to a $135 million improvement in gross profit as a result of increased load margins, partiallyoffset by an increase in \nemployee headcount costs.(1)(2), (3)\n(4)\n(1\n)(2\n)(3) \n(4)\n59\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the main reason for the improvement in Freight adjusted EBITDA loss from 2020 to 2021?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the main reason for the improvement in Freight adjusted EBITDA loss from 2020 to 2021?", "answer": "The main reason for the improvement in Freight adjusted EBITDA loss from 2020 to 2021 is a $135 million improvement in gross profit as a result of increased load margins, partially offset by an increase in employee headcount costs"}

The decrease in cash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily driven by adecrease in our operating lease right-of-use assets, prepaid expense\ns and other assets and increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by loweraccounts payable and \noperating lease liabilities.Investing Activities\nNet\n cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $2.3 billion in acquisition of businesses,net of cash acquired,\n $1.1 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $982 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities, $297 million in purchases ofnotes\n receivable, and $298 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $2.3billion, proceeds from th\ne sale of equity method investments of $1.0 billion and proceeds from sale of non-marketable equity securities of $500 million.Net\n cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisting of $2.1 billion in purchases of marketablesecurities, $1.5 billion in acquisition of busine\nsses, net of cash acquired and $616 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds frommaturities and sales o\nf marketable securities of $1.4 billion.Financing Activities\nNet\n cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was  $1.8  billion  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  primarily  consisting  of  $1.5  billion  of  proceeds  fromissuance\n of notes, net of issuance cost, $675 million of proceeds from the issuance and sale of subsidiary preferred stock units, partially offset by $307 million ofprincipal\n repayment on the non-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes related to the acquisition of Careem (“Careem Notes”) and $226 million principalpayments on finance leas\nes.Net\n cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was  $1.4  billion  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  primarily  consisting  of  $2.6  billion  of  proceeds  fromissuance of\n notes, net of issuance costs and $247 million of proceeds from issuance of subsidiary preferred stock units, partially offset by $891 million of principalrepayment on Careem Notes and $527 \nmillion of principal repayment on term loan and notes.Other Information\nAs\n of December 31, 2021, $2.2 billion of our $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the UnitedStates\n may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result inimmaterial\n tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We arein compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of December 31, 202\n1, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sourcesof\n funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capitalrequirements,\n collateral  requirements,  potential  acquisitions,  potential  prepayments  of  contested  indirect  tax  assessments  (“pay-to-play”),  and  other  liquidityrequirements through at\n least the next 12 months. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidityduring\n the COVID-19 pandemic. As the circumstances around the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic's impactto us worldwide including our financ\nial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.Purchase Commitments\nWe\n have non-cancelable commitments for network and cloud services, background checks, and other items in the ordinary course of business. These amountsare\n determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated. As of December 31, 2021, we had $394million in non-cancel\nable commitments, with varying expiration terms through December 15, 2026.Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe\n believe  that the following accounting  policies  involve a high degree  of judgment  and complexity  and are critical  to understanding  and evaluating  ourconsolidated\n financial condition and results of our operations. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accountingestimate\n to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could havebeen\n used,  or  changes  in  the  accounting  estimates  that  are  reasonably  likely  to  occur  periodically,  could  materially  impact  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,liabilities, revenu\ne and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience andon\n various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  thecarrying\n values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe\n are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur\n exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025\n and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour\n consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis pointincrease or decrease in interest\n rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of\n our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin\n periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 millionas of December 31, 2021.\nInvestment Risk\nOur\n investment  policy  objective  aims  to  preserve  capital  and  meet  liquidity  requirements  without  significantly  increasing  risk.  We  had  cash  and  cashequivalents including\n restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Wedid\n not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money marketfunds\n and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest raterisk.\n Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change ininterest rates would n\not have a material effect on our financial results.We\n are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently\n public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult tovalue\n given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.These investments\n in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes inthe\n fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a setperiod of time afte\nr a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency Risk\nWe\n transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us tothe\n risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operatingexpenses\n denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Accordingly,  changes  in  exchange  rates  may  negatively  affect  our  future  revenue  and  otheroperating\n results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar isdiversified across geogr\naphic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We\n have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurementof our\n asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currencyrates\n may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of ourconsolidated\n financial  statements.  For  additional  information,  see  the  disclosure  included  in  Note  1  –  Description  of  Business  and  Summary  of  SignificantAccounting\n Policies  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Part  II,  Item  8,  “Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,”  of  thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe\n derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products andDelivery\n offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users. Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants withend-users\n to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and wehave no performance oblig\nation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment\n is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-userand\n are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). Wehave\n concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Deliverytransactions.\n The  assessment  of  whether  we  are  considered  the  principal  or  the  agent  in  a  transaction  could  impact  the  accounting  for  certain  payments  andincentives provided to Drive\nrs and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In\n certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsettingagainst\n any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,uncollected service fees for ca\nsh trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver Incentives\nWe\n offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided tocustomers\n are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the servicereceived. Incentives offered i\nn exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriateclassification\n of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotionswhich are recorded as a r\neduction of revenue.Business Combinations\nWe\n allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimatedfair\n values. The excess of the fair  value of purchase  consideration  over the fair values of these identifiable  assets and liabilities  is recorded as goodwill. Suchvaluations\n require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certainintangible\n assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,and\n trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, usefullives, and discount rates.\nManagement's\n estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as aresult,\n actual  results  may  differ  from  estimates.  Allocation  of  purchase  consideration  to  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  affects  our  amortization  expense,  asacquired\n finite-lived  intangible  assets  are  amortized  over  the  useful  life,  whereas  any  indefinite  lived  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  are  not  amortized.During\n the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,with the corresponding offset \nto goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Embedded Derivatives\nDuring\n 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are composed ofconversion\n options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the totalnumber\n of  shares  of  our  common  stock  delivered  to  settle  these  embedded  features  will  have  a  fixed  value.  These  conversion  options  are  bifurcated  from  theunderlying\n instrument  and  accounted  for  and  valued  separately  from  the  host  instrument.  Embedded  derivatives  are  recognized  as  derivative  liabilities  on  ourconsolidated\n balance  sheet.  We  measure  these  instruments  at  their  estimated  fair  value  and  recognize  changes  in  their  estimated  fair  value  in  other  income(expense), net in our consolid\nated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.We\n value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial PublicOffering (“QIPO”) conversion option \n(“QIPO Conversion Option”).

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nnotes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPOdates\n to the valuation date. The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield,which\n was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes. The discount rate is updated during eachperiod to reflect th\ne yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.Upon\n closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock.

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost andare\n subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.Investments\n in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date withthe\n changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.

This valuation requiresjudgment\n due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimatedfair\n value  of  our  investments  in  privately  held  companies,  we  utilize  the  most  recent  data  available  including  observed  transactions  such  as  equity  financingtransactions of the\n investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees’ securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similarto the equity and debt secur\nities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We\n assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equitysecurities\n includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If anequity\n investment  is  considered  to  be  impaired  we  will  establish  a  new  carrying  value  for  the  investment  and  recognize  an  impairment  loss  through  ourconsolidated\n statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below itsamortized\n cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, thedifference\n between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-downof\n the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factorsconsidered\n in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit qualityof\n the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we comparethe\n present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related\n impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balancesheet\n with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensiveincome\n (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and correspondingreduction in the allowanc\ne for credit loss.Equity Method Investments\nWe\n account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence,but not\n a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, werecognize\n through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities’ netincome or\n loss, and the amortization of basis differences.

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inp\nuts and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interestrates, expected stock pr\nice volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black\n-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:•\nExpected term. We estimate the exp ected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.•\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free inter est rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.•\nExpected volatility.  We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility ofour\n own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term. Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter thanthe expected term, we cons\nider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.•\nExpected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is z ero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.We\n continue  to  use  judgment  in  evaluating  the  expected  volatility  and  expected  term  utilized  in  our  stock-based  compensation  expense  calculation  on  aprospective\n basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expectedterm, which could mater\nially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee\n Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,“Financial Statements \nand Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.68\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the expected dividend yield used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the expected dividend yield used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model?", "answer": "zero percent"}

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because\n of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness\n to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur\nes may deteriorate.Critical Audit Matters\nThe\n critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor\n required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and(ii)\n involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe\n consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on thecritical audit matters or on the\n accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and De\nlivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs\n described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of theCompany’s\n platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged toend-users\n for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal oragent\n in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.  This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  thepresentation\n of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the yearended\n December  31,  2021,  the  Company’s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3  billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,refunds, and credits provided \nto end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The\n principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, includingincentives,\n discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing thepresentation\n of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,which\n in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whethertransaction attributes were a\nppropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing\n the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These  procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to  the  Company’s  revenue  recognition  process,  including  controls  over  thepresentation of Mobility \nand Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, triptransaction attributes\n and assessing management’s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driverstatements,\n rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue andincome statement classification.\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs\n described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of\n the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor\n losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied\n to historical  claim  and loss experience.  In addition,  management  uses assumptions  based  on actuarial  judgment  related  to claim  and loss developmentpatterns\n and  expected  loss  costs,  which  consider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.  These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  bymanagement\n and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  new  information  becomes  known.  The  Company’s  short-term  and  long-term  insurance  reserves  as  ofDecember 31, 2021 totaled $4.0 bil\nlion.The\n principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  the  valuation  of  insurance  reserves  is  a  critical  audit  matter  are  thesignificant\n judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivityand\n effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  the  actuarial  methods  and  management’s  significant  assumptions  related  to  lossdevelopment patterns and \nexpected loss costs. The audit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing\n the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s valuation of insurance reserves, including controls over thedevelopment\n of  the  significant  assumptions  related  to  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss  costs.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe\n consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on thecritical audit matters or on the\n accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and De\nlivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs\n described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of theCompany’s\n platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged toend-users\n for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal oragent\n in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.  This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  thepresentation\n of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the yearended\n December  31,  2021,  the  Company’s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3  billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,refunds, and credits provided \nto end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The\n principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, includingincentives,\n discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing thepresentation\n of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,which\n in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whethertransaction attributes were a\nppropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing\n the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These  procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to  the  Company’s  revenue  recognition  process,  including  controls  over  thepresentation of Mobility \nand Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, triptransaction attributes\n and assessing management’s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driverstatements,\n rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue andincome statement classification.\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs\n described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of\n the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor\n losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied\n to historical  claim  and loss experience.  In addition,  management  uses assumptions  based  on actuarial  judgment  related  to claim  and loss developmentpatterns\n and  expected  loss  costs,  which  consider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.  These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  bymanagement\n and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  new  information  becomes  known.  The  Company’s  short-term  and  long-term  insurance  reserves  as  ofDecember 31, 2021 totaled $4.0 bil\nlion.The\n principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  the  valuation  of  insurance  reserves  is  a  critical  audit  matter  are  thesignificant\n judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivityand\n effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  the  actuarial  methods  and  management’s  significant  assumptions  related  to  lossdevelopment patterns and \nexpected loss costs.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nUBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUber\n Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber isa\n technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber\n develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connectsconsumers\n (“Rider(s)”)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (“Mobility  Driver(s)”)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and  other  consumers(“Eaters”)\n with restaurants,  grocers  and other stores (collectively,  “Merchants”)  with delivery  service  providers  (“Couriers”)  for meal  preparation,  grocery  andother\n delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas\n “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shipp\ners with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our\n technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe\n accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(“GAAP”).\n We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (“VIE”)where\n we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.  Refer  to  Note  16  –  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.  All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been e\nliminated.Use of Estimates\nThe preparation\n of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, an\nd other assumptions whichmanagement\n believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments\n and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired\n intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain\n deferred tax assets and tax liabilities;  insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could\n differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain\n of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments\n and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial\n markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial perfor\nmance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit Risk\nCash\n and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit\n risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency\n securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial\n issuer. Cash deposits  typically  exceed  insured  limits  and are  placed  with financial  institutions  around the  world that  we believe  are  of high creditquality.\n We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld\n by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on alimited\n number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment service providers”) to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment serviceproviders\n are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for theyears ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\nWe\n have  incurred  significant  net  losses  since  inception  and  had  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $23.6  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021.  Our  operations  havehistorically\n been funded through equity and debt financings.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nfinancing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt instruments.In\n March  2020,  the  World  Health  Organization  declared  the  outbreak  of  COVID-19  a  pandemic.  COVID-19  has  rapidly  impacted  market  and  economicconditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented\n, including business activities and travelrestrictions,\n and  “shelter-at-home”  orders,  that  have  had  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business  and  operations  by  reducing,  in  particular,  the  global  demand  forMobility\n offerings,  while  accelerating  the  growth  of  our  Delivery  offerings.  In  light  of  the  evolving  nature  of  COVID-19  and  the  uncertainty  it  continues  toproduce\n around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results ofoperations,\n financial position, liquidity, and cash flows.

We elected the “package of practical expedients,” which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 ourprior conclusions\n about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from leasecomponents, therefore, we a\nccount for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption forall leases that qualify.\nWe\n determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economicbenefits\n from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to anasset\n which  we  do  not  own.  Right  of  use  (“ROU”)  assets  represent  our  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  and  lease  liabilities  represent  ourobligation\n to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilitiesare\n recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the futurelease\n payments  is  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  (“IBR”),  because  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  most  of  our  leases  is  not  readily  determinable.  The  IBR  is  ahypothetical\n rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to thelease\n payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixedpayments\n or  in-substance  fixed  payments  are  included  in  our  lease  liability  calculation.  Variable  lease  payments  may  include  costs  such  as  common  areamaintenance,\n utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for thosepayments are incurred.\nOperating\n leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidatedbalance\n sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidatedbalance\n sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term.

Thepurchase\n price  of  the  acquisition  is  allocated  to  the  tangible  and  intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  based  on  their  estimated  fair  values  at  theacquisition\n date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one yearfrom the\n acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusionof\n the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments arerecorded in the consolida\nted statements of operations. Refer to Note 18 – Business Combinations for further information.Goodwill\nGoodwill\n represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting unitsexpected\n to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes incircumstances\n indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigngoodwill using a relative fair\n value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence ofevents\n or circumstances  leads to a determination  that it  is more likely  than not that the  fair  value  of a reporting  unit is less than  its carrying  amount. If,  afterassessing\n the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,then additional impai\nrment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The\n quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value,goodwill is considered not to be i\nmpaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairmentloss\n will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nLeasesWe\n adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition methodand\n used the effective date as the date of initial application. We elected the “package of practical expedients,” which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 ourprior conclusions\n about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from leasecomponents, therefore, we a\nccount for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption forall leases that qualify.\nWe\n determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economicbenefits\n from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to anasset\n which  we  do  not  own.  Right  of  use  (“ROU”)  assets  represent  our  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  and  lease  liabilities  represent  ourobligation\n to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilitiesare\n recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the futurelease\n payments  is  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  (“IBR”),  because  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  most  of  our  leases  is  not  readily  determinable.  The  IBR  is  ahypothetical\n rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to thelease\n payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixedpayments\n or  in-substance  fixed  payments  are  included  in  our  lease  liability  calculation.  Variable  lease  payments  may  include  costs  such  as  common  areamaintenance,\n utilities, real estate taxes or other costs.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nAll Other RevenueE-Bikes and E-Scooters\nPrior\n to the second quarter of 2020, All Other revenue (formerly our Other Bets segment) consisted primarily of revenue from New Mobility products, whichwere\n derived from operating leases as defined within ASC 842. New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a varietyof\n modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (“New Mobility”). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We wereresponsible for\n providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user’s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of eachtrip.\n After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.Refer to Note 19 – Divestitures fo\nr further information on the JUMP Divestiture.Advanced Technologies Group (“ATG”) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Rev\nenueIn\n 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next–generation self-driving technology. Under thiscollaboration\n agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition andpresentation of the consid\neration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 – Non-Controlling Interests for further information.Incentives to Customers\nIncentives\n provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fairvalue\n of  the  good  or  service  received.  Incentives  to  customers  that  are  not  provided  in  exchange  for  a  distinct  good  or  service  are  evaluated  as  variableconsideration,\n in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Sinceincentives are earn\ned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring\n new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. Weexpense\n such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient underASC\n 340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.  The  amountrecorded\n as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is establishedusing\n amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,2019, 2020 and 2021 were immateria\nl.In\n some  transactions,  incentives  and  payments  made  to  customers  may  exceed  the  revenue  earned  in  the  transaction.  In  these  transactions,  the  resultingshortfall amount is re\ncorded as a reduction of revenue.Advertising Revenue\nWe\n derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.Advertising revenue is recognized\n when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in theamount billed to merchants\n as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.End-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discountsand promotions and include:\nTargeted end-user\n discounts and promotions: These  discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,or\n generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or mealdeliveries\n during  a  limited  time  period.  We  record  the  cost  of  these  discounts  and  promotions  to  end-users  who  are  not  our  customers  as  sales  and  marketingexpenses at the time th\ney are redeemed by the end-user.End-user referrals:\n These  referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platformand\n the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nAll Other RevenueE-Bikes and E-Scooters\nPrior\n to the second quarter of 2020, All Other revenue (formerly our Other Bets segment) consisted primarily of revenue from New Mobility products, whichwere\n derived from operating leases as defined within ASC 842. New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a varietyof\n modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (“New Mobility”). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We wereresponsible for\n providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user’s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of eachtrip.\n After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.Refer to Note 19 – Divestitures fo\nr further information on the JUMP Divestiture.Advanced Technologies Group (“ATG”) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Rev\nenueIn\n 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next–generation self-driving technology. Under thiscollaboration\n agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition andpresentation of the consid\neration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 – Non-Controlling Interests for further information.Incentives to Customers\nIncentives\n provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fairvalue\n of  the  good  or  service  received.  Incentives  to  customers  that  are  not  provided  in  exchange  for  a  distinct  good  or  service  are  evaluated  as  variableconsideration,\n in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Sinceincentives are earn\ned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring\n new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. Weexpense\n such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient underASC\n 340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.  The  amountrecorded\n as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is establishedusing\n amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,2019, 2020 and 2021 were immateria\nl.In\n some  transactions,  incentives  and  payments  made  to  customers  may  exceed  the  revenue  earned  in  the  transaction.  In  these  transactions,  the  resultingshortfall amount is re\ncorded as a reduction of revenue.Advertising Revenue\nWe\n derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.Advertising revenue is recognized\n when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in theamount billed to merchants\n as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.End-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discountsand promotions and include:\nTargeted end-user\n discounts and promotions: These  discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,or\n generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or mealdeliveries\n during  a  limited  time  period.  We  record  the  cost  of  these  discounts  and  promotions  to  end-users  who  are  not  our  customers  as  sales  and  marketingexpenses at the time th\ney are redeemed by the end-user.End-user referrals:\n These  referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platformand\n the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nLeasesWe\n adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition methodand\n used the effective date as the date of initial application. We elected the “package of practical expedients,” which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 ourprior conclusions\n about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from leasecomponents, therefore, we a\nccount for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption forall leases that qualify.\nWe\n determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economicbenefits\n from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to anasset\n which  we  do  not  own.  Right  of  use  (“ROU”)  assets  represent  our  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  and  lease  liabilities  represent  ourobligation\n to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilitiesare\n recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the futurelease\n payments  is  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  (“IBR”),  because  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  most  of  our  leases  is  not  readily  determinable.  The  IBR  is  ahypothetical\n rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to thelease\n payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixedpayments\n or  in-substance  fixed  payments  are  included  in  our  lease  liability  calculation.  Variable  lease  payments  may  include  costs  such  as  common  areamaintenance,\n utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for thosepayments are incurred.\nOperating\n leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidatedbalance\n sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidatedbalance\n sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense isrecognized\n as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. As of December31, 2020 and 2021, less than 12% of our operat\ning lease ROU assets related to leased assets were outside of the U.S.Acquisitions\nWe\n account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). Thepurchase\n price  of  the  acquisition  is  allocated  to  the  tangible  and  intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  based  on  their  estimated  fair  values  at  theacquisition\n date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one yearfrom the\n acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusionof\n the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments arerecorded in the consolida\nted statements of operations. Refer to Note 18 – Business Combinations for further information.Goodwill\nGoodwill\n represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting unitsexpected\n to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes incircumstances\n indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigngoodwill using a relative fair\n value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence ofevents\n or circumstances  leads to a determination  that it  is more likely  than not that the  fair  value  of a reporting  unit is less than  its carrying  amount. If,  afterassessing\n the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,then additional impai\nrment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The\n quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value,goodwill is considered not to be i\nmpaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairmentloss\n will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill andIntangible Assets for furth\ner information.Intangible Assets, Net\nIntangible\n assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one  to 18 years.

We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities forimpairment\n at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include,but\n would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, asignificant\n adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,or\n a  completed  auction  process  for  the  same  or  similar  securities  for  an  amount  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  those  securities.

Under  ASC  326,  at  each  reporting  period,  we  evaluate  our  available-for-sale  debtsecurities\n at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstanceswhere\n we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value andamortized\n cost  is  recognized  as  a  loss  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  with  a  corresponding  write-down  of  the  security’s  amortized  cost.  Incircumstances\n where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether acredit\n loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, creditratings\n actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cashflows\n of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to thedifference between fair value\n and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustmentto net\n income (loss).

The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest pri\nority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and thelowest priority to unobservabl\ne inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    Level 1    Observable inputs such as quot\ned prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level\n 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that arenot active or inputs \nother than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which th\nere is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our\n primary  financial  instruments  include  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  investments,  accounts  payable,  accruedliabilities, long-t\nerm debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants.

We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contractsshall\n be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,which\n represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-usersof\n $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions. For the year endedDecember\n 31,  2021,  we  recognized  revenue  from  end-users  of  $710  million  and  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  $2.4  billionassociated with these del\nivery transactions.In all\n markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, thisclass of end-users are not ou\nr customers.Principal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in\n determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentationof\n revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. “gross”), or we arrange for otherparties\n to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. “net”). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers andMerchants and discounts and promo\ntions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.For\n the  majority  of  Mobility  and  Delivery  transactions,  our  role  is  to  provide  the  Uber  Service  to  Drivers  and Merchants  to  facilitate  a  successful  trip  orDelivery\n service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchaseor\n otherwise obtain control of the Drivers’ and Merchants’ goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants toperform\n the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.\n As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsiblefor\n Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services. While we facilitate setting the price for Mobilityand\n Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does notresult in us controlling th\ne services provided to end-users.In\n the  vast  majority  of  transactions  with end-users,  we act  as  an agent  of  the  Driver  or  Merchant  by connecting  end-users  seeking  Mobility  and Deliveryservices\n with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services. Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfullycompleted transaction with end-users. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a\n net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing theservice\n to Drivers and Merchants. In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to providedelivery\n services.  In  these  markets,  we  are  the  principal  for  the  Delivery  services  and  present  Delivery  revenue  on  a  gross  basis  because  we  are  primarilyresponsible for the servi\nces.Mobility\nWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Rider\ns and successfullycomplete a trip via the Platf\norm. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.Depending\n on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amountpaid by an\n end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned byDrivers,\n end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing servicesprovided.\n Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of timefollowing the completion of \na trip.88\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the role of Uber in the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the role of Uber in the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions?", "answer": "We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchase or otherwise obtain control of the Drivers' and Merchants' goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants to perform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nAll Other RevenueE-Bikes and E-Scooters\nPrior\n to the second quarter of 2020, All Other revenue (formerly our Other Bets segment) consisted primarily of revenue from New Mobility products, whichwere\n derived from operating leases as defined within ASC 842. New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a varietyof\n modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (“New Mobility”). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We wereresponsible for\n providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user’s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of eachtrip.\n After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.Refer to Note 19 – Divestitures fo\nr further information on the JUMP Divestiture.Advanced Technologies Group (“ATG”) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Rev\nenueIn\n 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next–generation self-driving technology. Under thiscollaboration\n agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition andpresentation of the consid\neration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 – Non-Controlling Interests for further information.Incentives to Customers\nIncentives\n provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fairvalue\n of  the  good  or  service  received.  Incentives  to  customers  that  are  not  provided  in  exchange  for  a  distinct  good  or  service  are  evaluated  as  variableconsideration,\n in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Sinceincentives are earn\ned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring\n new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. Weexpense\n such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient underASC\n 340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.  The  amountrecorded\n as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is establishedusing\n amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,2019, 2020 and 2021 were immateria\nl.In\n some  transactions,  incentives  and  payments  made  to  customers  may  exceed  the  revenue  earned  in  the  transaction.  In  these  transactions,  the  resultingshortfall amount is re\ncorded as a reduction of revenue.Advertising Revenue\nWe\n derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.Advertising revenue is recognized\n when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in theamount billed to merchants\n as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.End-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discountsand promotions and include:\nTargeted end-user\n discounts and promotions: These  discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,or\n generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or mealdeliveries\n during  a  limited  time  period.  We  record  the  cost  of  these  discounts  and  promotions  to  end-users  who  are  not  our  customers  as  sales  and  marketingexpenses at the time th\ney are redeemed by the end-user.End-user referrals:\n These  referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platformand\n the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform. These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referringend-user.\n These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform. We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales andmarketing expenses at the\n time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.Market-wide\n promotions: These  promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants toend-users\n who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market. This also includes any discounts offered under oursubscription\n offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which enable End-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides.Accordingly, we record the cost o\nf these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the transaction is completed.90\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the name of the program that enables end-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the name of the program that enables end-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides?", "answer": "Uber Rewards"}

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nMarket-Based AwardsWe\n have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: service-based service conditions, performance-based\n conditions,  and/or  market-based  conditions.  The  service-based  condition  for  these  awards  generally  is  satisfied  over  four  years.  The  performance-basedconditions\n generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-based awards. The market-bas\ned conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.For\n market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions includingexpected\n stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimate thevolatility\n of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average  historical  stock price  volatility  of comparable  publicly-traded  companies  in itsindustry group.\n We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect atthe\n time of grant. Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock andestimated the expected capital raise\n percentage based on management's expectations at the time of measurement of the award's value.We\n record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over therequisite\n service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. We determine the requisite service period by comparingthe\n derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisiteservice period.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)\nWe recognize stock-bas\ned expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The ESPP provides fortwelve-month\n offering  periods,  and  each  offering  period  includes  two  purchase  periods  of  approximately  six  months.  The  ESPP  allows  eligible  employees  topurchase\n shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimatethe\n fair  value  of  shares  to  be  issued  under  the  ESPP  based  on  a  combination  of  options  valued using  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model.  In  2019,  wedetermine\n volatility over an expected term of six months based on our historical volatility and twelve months based on the average of our historical volatility andour\n peer group. In 2020 and 2021, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimatethe expected term based o\nn the contractual term.Common Stock Fair Value\nSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair va\nlue of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.Prior\n to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensivebusiness,\n finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculatingstock-based\n compensation  expense.  We  obtained  contemporaneous  third-party  valuations  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in  determining  fair  value.  Thesecontemporaneous\n third-party  valuations  used  the  methodologies,  approaches  and  assumptions  consistent  with  the  American  Institute  of  Certified  PublicAccountants Practice Guide, \nValuation of Privately-Held -Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Income Taxes\nWe\n account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected futuretax consequences of events th\nat have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.We\n account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax positionwhen\n it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe technical merits. Income tax\n positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.We\n recognize  accrued  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  in  the  provision  for  (benefit  from)  income  taxes  in  the  consolidatedstatements of operations.\nValuation\n allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized basedon the\n weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of theappropriate\n character  (for  example,  ordinary  income  or  capital  gain)  within  the  carryback  or  carryforward  periods  available  under  the  applicable  tax  law.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nMarket-Based AwardsWe\n have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: service-based service conditions, performance-based\n conditions,  and/or  market-based  conditions.  The  service-based  condition  for  these  awards  generally  is  satisfied  over  four  years.  The  performance-basedconditions\n generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-based awards. The market-bas\ned conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.For\n market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions includingexpected\n stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimate thevolatility\n of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average  historical  stock price  volatility  of comparable  publicly-traded  companies  in itsindustry group.\n We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect atthe\n time of grant. Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock andestimated the expected capital raise\n percentage based on management's expectations at the time of measurement of the award's value.We\n record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over therequisite\n service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. We determine the requisite service period by comparingthe\n derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisiteservice period.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)\nWe recognize stock-bas\ned expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The ESPP provides fortwelve-month\n offering  periods,  and  each  offering  period  includes  two  purchase  periods  of  approximately  six  months.  The  ESPP  allows  eligible  employees  topurchase\n shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimatethe\n fair  value  of  shares  to  be  issued  under  the  ESPP  based  on  a  combination  of  options  valued using  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model.  In  2019,  wedetermine\n volatility over an expected term of six months based on our historical volatility and twelve months based on the average of our historical volatility andour\n peer group. In 2020 and 2021, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimatethe expected term based o\nn the contractual term.Common Stock Fair Value\nSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair va\nlue of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.Prior\n to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensivebusiness,\n finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculatingstock-based\n compensation  expense.  We  obtained  contemporaneous  third-party  valuations  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in  determining  fair  value.  Thesecontemporaneous\n third-party  valuations  used  the  methodologies,  approaches  and  assumptions  consistent  with  the  American  Institute  of  Certified  PublicAccountants Practice Guide, \nValuation of Privately-Held -Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Income Taxes\nWe\n account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected futuretax consequences of events th\nat have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.We\n account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax positionwhen\n it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe technical merits. Income tax\n positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.We\n recognize  accrued  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  in  the  provision  for  (benefit  from)  income  taxes  in  the  consolidatedstatements of operations.\nValuation\n allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized basedon the\n weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of theappropriate\n character  (for  example,  ordinary  income  or  capital  gain)  within  the  carryback  or  carryforward  periods  available  under  the  applicable  tax  law.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nMarket-Based AwardsWe\n have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: service-based service conditions, performance-based\n conditions,  and/or  market-based  conditions.  The  service-based  condition  for  these  awards  generally  is  satisfied  over  four  years.  The  performance-basedconditions\n generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-based awards. The market-bas\ned conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.For\n market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions includingexpected\n stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimate thevolatility\n of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average  historical  stock price  volatility  of comparable  publicly-traded  companies  in itsindustry group.\n We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect atthe\n time of grant. Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock andestimated the expected capital raise\n percentage based on management's expectations at the time of measurement of the award's value.We\n record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over therequisite\n service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. We determine the requisite service period by comparingthe\n derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisiteservice period.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)\nWe recognize stock-bas\ned expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The ESPP provides fortwelve-month\n offering  periods,  and  each  offering  period  includes  two  purchase  periods  of  approximately  six  months.  The  ESPP  allows  eligible  employees  topurchase\n shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimatethe\n fair  value  of  shares  to  be  issued  under  the  ESPP  based  on  a  combination  of  options  valued using  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model.  In  2019,  wedetermine\n volatility over an expected term of six months based on our historical volatility and twelve months based on the average of our historical volatility andour\n peer group. In 2020 and 2021, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimatethe expected term based o\nn the contractual term.Common Stock Fair Value\nSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair va\nlue of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.Prior\n to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensivebusiness,\n finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculatingstock-based\n compensation  expense.  We  obtained  contemporaneous  third-party  valuations  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in  determining  fair  value.  Thesecontemporaneous\n third-party  valuations  used  the  methodologies,  approaches  and  assumptions  consistent  with  the  American  Institute  of  Certified  PublicAccountants Practice Guide, \nValuation of Privately-Held -Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Income Taxes\nWe\n account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected futuretax consequences of events th\nat have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.We\n account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax positionwhen\n it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe technical merits. Income tax\n positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.We\n recognize  accrued  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  in  the  provision  for  (benefit  from)  income  taxes  in  the  consolidatedstatements of operations.\nValuation\n allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized basedon the\n weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of theappropriate\n character  (for  example,  ordinary  income  or  capital  gain)  within  the  carryback  or  carryforward  periods  available  under  the  applicable  tax  law.  Weregularly\n review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversalsof existing\n temporary differences and tax planning strategies.

In  exchange  for  consideration  contributed,  wereceived\n a seat on MLU B.V.’s board and an initial 38% equity ownership interest consisting of common stock in MLU B.V. Certain contingent equity issuancesof MLU B.V. may dilute our equity owner\nship interest to approximately 33%. The investment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our abilityto exercise\n significant influence over MLU B.V. The initial fair value of our equity method investment in MLU B.V. was estimated using discounted cash flows ofMLU B.V. The equity ownership interest in MLU B.V. was 35% and 29% as of De\ncember 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.2020\nDuring\n 2020, Yandex contributed its Yandex.Carsharing business (“Drive”) into MLU B.V. in exchange for an additional equity interest.

The gain recognized on the dilution of our interest was not materialto\n our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. As part of this transaction, MLU B.V. contributed the assets and liabilities of itsautonomous\n driving unit into a new legal entity, Yandex Self Driving Group B.V. (“SDG”), in which Yandex contributed additional capital. The reduction of ourownership interest to 20% in SDG, initi\nally valued at $42 million, did not result in a material dilution gain.2021\nOn\n August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Yandex (the “Framework Agreement”) to restructure our joint ventures, MLU B.V. and SDG and wewould\n sell to Yandex (i) our 4.5% equity interest in MLU B.V. and (ii) our entire equity interest in SDG (the “Initial Closing”). Subsequent to the Initial Closing,Yandex\n spun-off,  by  way  of  demerger  from  MLU  B.V.,  its  delivery  businesses:  Yandex.Eats,  Yandex.Lavka  and  Yandex.Delivery  (collectively,  “DemergedBusinesses”).\n Immediately  following  the  demerger,  Yandex  acquired  all  of  our  equity  interest  in  the  Demerged  Businesses  (“Demerger  Share  Closing”).  Inconnection with the Framework Agreement, we granted Yandex an\n option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. duringthe\n two-year period following the Initial Closing. The total consideration paid by Yandex to us for the transaction was $1.0 billion in cash allocated as follows: (i)$276\n million for our 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V.; (ii) $412 million for our equity interest in the Demerged Businesses; (iii) $230 million for the MLUB.V.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nconsolidated statements of operations. Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair valueof these securities based\n on valuation methods, including the common stock equivalent (“CSE”) and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securitiesissued by the investee adjust\ned for contractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.The\n following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses from remeasurement (referred to as upward or downward adjustments) recorded in other income(expense),\n net in the consolidated statements of operations, and included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities held during theyears\n ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 based on the observable price in an orderly transaction for the same or similar security of the same issuers (inmillions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020 2021 Upward adjustments\n$ — $ — $ 71 Downward adjustments (including imp\nairment)— (1,690) — Total unrealized gain \n(loss) for non-marketable equity securities$ — $ (1,690) $ 71 We\n evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potentialimpairment\n indicators.  This evaluation  consists  of  several  factors  including,  but  not limited  to,  an assessment  of a  significant  adverse  change  in  the  economicenvironment,\n significant  adverse  changes  in  the  general  market  condition  of  the  geographies  and  industries  in  which  our  investees  operate,  and  other  publiclyavailable\n information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities. As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising fromCOVID-19,\n we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, wasless than their carry\ning value.To\n determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,weighted\n at  80%  and  20%,  respectively.  The  CSE  method  assumes  an  if-converted  scenario,  where  the  OPM  approach  allocates  equity  value  to  individualsecurities\n within  the  investees’  capital  structure  based  on  contractual  rights  and  preferences.  We  computed  a  range  of  market  adjustments  based  on  observedmarket\n valuation declines of Didi’s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securitiesoccurred\n in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs areconsidered\n indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from thelatest\n financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.A\n lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes ofallocating value in th\ne OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event wouldresult\n in  higher  valuation  (due  to  access  to  public  markets  and  reduction  in  cost  of  capital),  reduces  valuation  uncertainty,  and  generally  assumes  market  andmacro-economic\n conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, werecorded an impairm\nent charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020. There wasno remeasurement even\nt for our investment in Didi that occurred during the remainder of 2020.The following table summar\nizes information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation for our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020:Fair value method\nKey unobservable input CSE\nMarket adjustment (20)% OPM\nVolatility 39% Estimated time to liquidity\n2.0 years Market adjustment\n(40)% During\n the first quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of $500 million of our Didi shares and realized immaterial gains from this transaction.

As a result, we derecognized our entire equity interest in the Demerged Businesses and recognized again of $242 million in other \nincome (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.MLU B.V. Call Option\nThe\n MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, initially valued at $230 millionand measured\n at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Theexercise\n price  of  the  MLU  B.V.  Call  Option  is  approximately  $1.8  billion,  subject  to  certain  adjustments  based  on  the  timing  of  the  option  exercise.  As  ofDecember\n 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million, including the recognition of an immaterial gain for the fair value change duringthe\n year ended December 31, 2021. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulatedmultiple\n scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were underlyingbusiness value, option term of 1.7 y\nears, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price (Level 3).MLU B.V. Basis Difference\nIncluded\n in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionateshare\n of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V.and\n amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translationadjustments represent\ning fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar.The table below provides the co\nmposition of the basis difference as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):As of December 31, 2021\nEquity method goodwill\n$ 545 Intangible assets, net \nof accumulated amortization54 Deferred tax liabilities\n(12) Cumulative currency tr\nanslation adjustments(107) Basis difference\n$ 480 We\n amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line\n method.

We contributed $136 millioncash\n in exchange for a 45% interest in ECOP. The two LLC Partners own 45% and 10%, respectively. The equity ownership interest in ECOP remained at 45% asof December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nIn\n March 2020, the two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries took out new loans. Upon closing of the new financing, the proceeds were used to first pay off theexisting construction\n loan, then to cover the required operation reserve as well as various financing costs, and last, the remaining  proceeds were distributed back toUber\n and the LLC Partners based on their ownership percentage. As a result, Uber received $91 million from the ECOP as a return of capital investment, andreduced the investment \ncarrying value by the same amount.We\n have significant influence over ECOP and we account for our investment in ECOP under the equity method. At each reporting period and a quarter inarrears,\n we adjust the carrying value of our investment to reflect our proportionate share of ECOP’s income or loss, and any impairments, with a correspondingcredit\n or  debit,  respectively,  to  income  or  loss  from  equity  method  investment,  net  of  tax  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations.

Therefore,the 2025 Convertible Notes are c\nlassified as long-term.The initial\n conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately$80.84\n per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid specialinterest.\nUpon\n conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash andshares of\n our common stock, at our election. We may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, atour\n option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for atleast\n 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, andincluding,\n the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amountof the notes to be redeem\ned, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.The\n indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, theincurrence of indebtedn\ness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries.Prior\n to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recordedas\n equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liabilitycomponent\n (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equitycomponent\n of  the  2025  Convertible  Notes  was  included  in  additional  paid-in  capital  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  was  notremeasured\n as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes asof the pricing date, we used th\ne binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.Effective\n January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease toadditional paid-in capital\n of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to theopening\n accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 ConvertibleNotes as a single liabili\nty measured at its amortized cost.The\n fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are notactive, which is considered \na Level 2 valuation input.Senior Notes\nIn\n October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November 1, 2023 (the “2023 Senior Notes”) and eight-year\n notes  with  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $1.5  billion  due  on  November  1,  2026  (the  “2026  Senior  Notes”)  in  a  private  placement  offering  totaling  $2.0billion.\n We issued the 2023 and 2026 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately $9 million for debt issuance costs.

The price was $45.00 per share. We received netproceeds of\n approximately $8.0 billion from the IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $106 million and offering expenses. Upon closingof\n the IPO: (i) all shares of our outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 905 million shares of common stock; (ii) holdersof\n the 2021 and 2022 Convertible Notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into 94 million shares of common stock; and, (iii) an outstanding warrant whichbecame\n exercisable upon the closing of the IPO was exercised to purchase 0.2 million shares of common stock. In addition, we recognized a net gain of $327million\n in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations upon conversion of the 2021 and 2022 Convertible Notes during the secondquarter\n of  2019,  which  consisted  of  $444  million  gain  on  extinguishment  of  debt  and  settlement  of  derivatives,  partially  offset  by  $117  million  loss  from  thechange in\n fair value of embedded derivatives prior to settlement. The extinguishment of debt resulted in the derecognition of the carrying value of the debt balanceand settlement of emb\nedded derivatives.We\n had granted RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of both time-based service and performance-based  conditions.Through\n May 9, 2019, no stock-based compensation expense had been recognized for such awards with a performance condition based on the occurrence of aqualifying\n event (such as an IPO), as such qualifying event was not probable. Upon our IPO, we recognized $3.6 billion of stock-based compensation expense.Upon\n the IPO, shares were issued to satisfy the vesting of RSUs with a performance condition. To meet the related tax withholding requirements, we withheld 29million\n of the 76 million shares of common stock issued. Based on the IPO public offering price of $45.00 per share, the tax withholding obligation was $1.3billion.\nAs\n a  result  of  stock-based  compensation  expense  for  vested  and  unvested  RSUs  upon  the  IPO,  we  recorded  an  additional  deferred  tax  assetof approximately $1.1 bill\nion that was offset by a full valuation allowance.PayPal, Inc.

Also during 2019, the warrant to purchase 150,071 Series E redeemable convertible preferred stock wasexercised. As a\n result of the IPO, both the Series G and Series E warrants automatically converted to shares of common stock. For additional information related toour IPO, refer to section above \ntitled “Initial Public Offering.”Preferred Stock\nAfter\n conversion  of the above mentioned  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock into common stock upon closing of our IPO, our board of directors  wasgranted\n the authority to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including votingrights,\n of  those  shares  without  any  further  vote  or  action  by  the  stockholders.  As  of  December  31,  2020  and  2021,  there  was  no  preferred  stock  issued  andoutstanding.\nCommon Stock\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have the authority to\n issue 5.0 billion shares of common stock with a par value of $0.00001 per share.

We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative andaudit\n proceedings,  asserting  claims  by  or  on  behalf  of  Drivers  that  Drivers  are  misclassified  as  independent  contractors.  In  connection  with  the  enactment  ofCalifornia\n State Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number ofmisclassification\n claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount orrange\n of reasonably  possible loss will not, either  individually  or in the aggregate,  have a material  adverse  effect  on our business, financial  position, results  ofoperations,\n or cash flows.

AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the“ABC”\n test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workersperforming\n services  for  a  hiring  entity  are  considered  employees  unless  the  hiring  entity  can  demonstrate  three  things:  the  worker  (A)  is  free  from  the  hiringentity’s\n control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work ortype of business performed fo\nr the hiring entity.On\n May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint inSan\n Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damagesrelated to the alleged competitive\n advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On\n August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the\n Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed apetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Co\nurt. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November2020, and requested that the Court o\nf Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.Proposition\n 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers.

At\n the option of the Investors, the Preferred Units are convertible into common units of Apparate, initially on a one-for-one basis but subject to potentialadjustment,\n as  defined  by  the  Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  at  any  time.  The  Preferred  Units  are  entitled  to  certain  distributions,  including  primarilydividends\n which are payable in cash or in-kind (at Apparate's discretion), and accrue quarterly, compounded on the last day of each quarter at a 4.5% annual rate.The Preferred Units are en\ntitled to distributions upon the occurrence of a sale or liquidation of Apparate representing an amount that is equal to the greater of (i) theoriginal investment\n plus any accrued but unpaid amounts, and (ii) their share of distributions assuming conversion to common units of Apparate immediately priorto\n the  sale  or  liquidation  event.  The  quarterly  dividend,  along  with  any  attributed  prorated  share  of  Apparate’s  net  income  (if  applicable),  are  included  in  netincome\n (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations. The Preferred Units do not participate in net lossesdue to a liquidation pref\nerence.SoftBank’s Preferred Units\nBeginning\n on July 2, 2026, SoftBank has the option to put to us all, but not less than all, of its initial investment in Preferred Units at a price equal to thenumber of SoftBank’s Preferred Units multiplied by the greater of\n (i) the original investment plus any accrued but unpaid amounts per unit and (ii) the fair value ofthe\n Preferred Units at the time of conversion (the “Put/Call Price”). Beginning on July 2, 2026, we can call all, but not less than all, of the Preferred Units held bySoftBank\n at the Put/Call Price. We have the option to settle all, or a portion of, the Put/Call Price with its common stock and any remainder will be satisfied incash.\n The put and call were determined to be embedded features within the SoftBank Preferred Units since they are not separately exercisable or legally detachedfrom the SoftBank Preferred Uni\nts.As\n of December 31, 2020, the SoftBank Preferred Units were classified as redeemable non-controlling interests in our consolidated financial statements andreported\n at the Put/Call Price which was determined as of the balance sheet date. The initial fair value of SoftBank’s Preferred Units was determined based on ahybrid\n method with the option pricing model as the primary methodology. This method used Level 3 fair value measurement inputs as well as an assumed equalprobability\n of the occurrence of a liquidation or exit event. The significant unobservable inputs used in the initial fair value measurement include: volatility of42%,\n time to liquidity of 5 years, and a discount for lack of marketability of 17%. A market approach was also used to corroborate the valuation derived from thehybrid\n method  at  issuance  to  evidence  that  the  issuance  price  of  the  Preferred  Units  approximated  their  fair  value.  There  was  no  fair  value  adjustment  toSoftBank’s redeemable non-con\ntrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2020.Toyota and DENSO’s Preferred Units\nAs of\n December 31, 2020, the Toyota and DENSO Preferred Units  were classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these units were not subjectto any mandatory redempt\nion rights or redemption rights that are outside our control. ATG Collaboration Agreement with Apparate, Toyota and DENSO\nIn\n conjunction  with  the  Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  discussed  above,  we  entered  into  a  three-year  joint  collaboration  agreement  among  Toyota,DENSO,\n and Apparate to develop next-generation self-driving technology (the “ATG Collaboration Agreement”), which became effective as of the closing of thePreferred\n Unit  Purchase  Agreement  in  July  2019.  Pursuant  to  the  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement,  Toyota  would  make  cash  payments  to  Apparate  up  to  anaggregate\n of $300 million, payable in six semi-annual installments during the three-year term of the ATG Collaboration Agreement. The cash payments for eachsix-month\n period were  contingent  upon the  mutual  agreement  between the  parties  on the  development  activities  and milestones  to be achieved  in the next  sixmonths\n and  the  continuation  of  the  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement.  The  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement  was  within  the  scope  of  ASC  808,  CollaborativeArrangements.\n The development  activities  were considered  ongoing and central  to the activities  of ATG. As a result,  the amounts received  from Toyota wererecognized as collaboration revenue in the All other segment (formerly ATG and Other Technolo\ngy Programs) ratably over the respective six-month service periodto\n which each payment relates, as the related development activities are performed. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we recognized $42million and $100 million, r\nespectively, as revenue under the ATG Collaboration Agreement.Divestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\n133\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the purpose of the ATG Collaboration Agreement between Toyota, DENSO, and Apparate, and how is the revenue recognized under this agreement?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the purpose of the ATG Collaboration Agreement between Toyota, DENSO, and Apparate, and how is the revenue recognized under this agreement?", "answer": "The purpose of the ATG Collaboration Agreement is to develop next-generation self-driving technology, and the revenue is recognized as collaboration revenue in the All other segment (formerly ATG and Other Technology Programs) ratably over the respective six-month service period to which each payment relates, as the related development activities are performed"}

Beingclassified\n as  a  transportation  provider  would  result  in  a  VAT  (20%)  on  Gross  Bookings  or  on  the  service  fee  that  we  charge  Drivers,  both  retroactively  andprospectively.\n HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and HMRC is also expected toconsider\n the U.K. Supreme Court’s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers’ worker classification, in determining whether we should be classified as a provider oftransportation\n services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a satisfactory resolution afterexhausting\n HMRC’s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the U.K. Tax Court, which may require the up-front payment tothe Tax Court (“pay-to-play\n”) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow. We continue to believe that we have meritorious defense in these proceedings.Our\n estimated  liability  is  inherently  subjective  due  to  the  complexity  and  uncertainty  of  these  matters  and  the  judicial  processes  in  certain  jurisdictions,therefore, the final outcome c\nould be different from the estimated liability recorded.129\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the outcome of the arbitration panel's interim award in the Google v.

{"prompt": "Consider the following:\n\nDivestiture of Uber Eats India to ZomatoOn\n January 21, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement and completed the divestiture of Uber Eats India to Zomato in exchange for (i) CCPS PreferredShares\n of Zomato convertible into ordinary shares representing, when converted, 9.99% of the total voting capital of Zomato and (ii) a non-interest bearing notereceivable to be repaid over the course of four years for reimbursement by Zomato of goods and service\ns tax. The estimated fair value of the consideration receivedincluded the investment v\nalued at $171 million and the $35 million of reimbursement of goods and services tax receivable from Zomato. As of December 31, 2021,we had collected substantially all of\n the receivable. The fair value of the CCPS Preferred Shares was based primarily on the observed transaction price for a similarsecurity\n issued to new investors  in close proximity  to the time  of our transaction  with Zomato. The transaction  resulted  in a gain on disposal of $154 millionrecognized\n in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2020. The income tax effect of the sale was notmaterial.\n The  divestiture  of  Uber  Eats  India  did  not  represent  a  strategic  shift  that  would  have  had  a  major  effect  on  our  operations  and  financial  results,  andtherefore does not quali\nfy for reporting as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes.Divestiture of JUMP and Investment in Lime\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a series of transactions and agreements wit\nh Lime to divest our JUMP business (the “JUMP Divestiture”).

We previously held Lime Series C preferred stock and fully vested warrants to purchase Lime Series C-1 preferred stock.Uber\n contributed hardware, equipment, intellectual property rights, technology, licensed technology, and permits of our JUMP business (collectively, “JUMPAssets”)\n in certain markets to Lime. JUMP Assets and previously held investments and warrants in Lime were exchanged for common stock (the “Lime CommonStock”),\n newly  issued  Lime  Series  1-C  preferred  stock  (“Lime  1-C  Preferred  Stock”)  and  fully  vested  warrants  to  purchase  Lime  Series  1-C  Preferred  Stock(“Lime\n 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants”). Lime Common Stock represents approximately 10% of fully-diluted (22% undiluted) ownership interest in Lime as ofDecember 31, 2021.\nConcurrently,\n we  contributed  $85  million  of  cash  to  Lime  in  exchange  for  a  secured  note  convertible  into  Lime  Series  3  Preferred  Stock  (the  “LimeConvertible\n Note”),  which  may  be  converted  at  any  time  at  our  election  representing  20%  initial  ownership  in  Lime  as  converted  on  a  fully-diluted  basis.  Inaddition,\n we entered into a call option agreement which gives us for a two-year period beginning May 7, 2022 the right to acquire all of the outstanding equityinterests\n of Lime held by its shareholders at fair value on the date of exercise, subject to regulatory approval.

CONTROLS AND\n PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe\n maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that wefile\n or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeperiods\n specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,including our\n Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule13a-15(b)\n under  the  Exchange  Act,  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  ourdisclosure\n controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief ExecutiveOfficer\n and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that,  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  our  disclosure  controls  andprocedures are effective at a reas\nonable assurance level.Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to\n our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected,or are reasonably likely t\no materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur\n management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controlover financial repor\nting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, ourmanagement\n does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.Any control system,\n no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that itsobjectives\n will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all controlissues and instances of fraud, \nif any, within our company have been detected.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur\n management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under theExchange\n Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in“Internal\n Control - Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on thatassessment,\n our  management  has  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  December  31,  2021.  In  addition,PricewaterhouseCoopers\n LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting asof December 31, 2021. You can find the fu\nll text of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attestation report in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In\n accordance with guidance from the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control overfinancial reporting\n for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded theinternal\n control activities of The Drizly Group, Inc. (“Drizly”), which we acquired in October 2021 and Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”), which we acquired inNovember\n 2021, as discussed in Note 18 – Business Combinations, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We have included the financial results ofthese\n in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

As of December 31, 2021, theFreight\n Series A preferred stock held by the Public Investment Fund were  classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these shares of preferred stock are not subject to any mand\natory redemption rights or redemption rights that are outside our control. Freight Series A-1 Preferred Sto\nckIn\n November 2021, Freight Holding entered into a 2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Freight Series A-1 Investors.

The purchase and sale of the Freight Series A-1 preferred stock took place concurrently with the closing of theTransplace acquisition. Re\nfer to Note 18 – Business Combinations for additional information on the Transplace acquisition.Freight\n Series  A-1  Investors  have  basic  rights  and  preferences  which  primarily  include:  one  vote  per  share;  conversion  rights  to  common  shares;  6%cumulative\n dividend  preference  and  liquidation  preference  (a  1.0x  liquidation  preference  of  original  issuance  price  plus  cumulative  unpaid  dividends).

Cornershop\nOn\n July  6,  2020,  we  closed  the  acquisition  of  a  55%  controlling  ownership  interest  in  CS-Global.  Refer  to  Note  18  –  Business  Combinations  for  furtherinformation.\n As of December 31, 2020, the non-controlling interest in CS-Global was classified as redeemable non-controlling interest because it is subject to aput/call\n agreement  which  was  not  solely  in  our  control  to  exercise.  At  each  balance  sheet  date,  the  redeemable  non-controlling  interest  was  measured  using  adiscounted\n cash  flow  methodology  and  the  carrying  value  was  adjusted  if  the  fair  value  was  higher  than  the  carrying  value.  The  initial  fair  value,  as  of  theacquisition date\n of July 6, 2020, was $290 million. There were no fair value adjustments to CS-Global’s redeemable non-controlling interest during the year endedDecember\n 31,  2020.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  Cornershop’s  financial  results  were  consolidated  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements  given  our  majorityownership interest.\nOn\n January 11, 2021, CS-Global exercised a call option and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico, which increased the redeemablenon-controlling interest. In August 20\n21, we acquired the minority shareholders' interests in CS-Global in an all-stock transaction and CS-Global became a wholly-owned\n subsidiary of ours.

Captains network represents the fair value of the underlyingnetwork\n with Careem drivers (called “Captains”). Developed technology represents the fair value of Careem’s technology. Trade names relate to the “Careem”trade name, trademarks, and\n domain names. The overall weighted average useful life of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is ten years.Tangible\n net assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as we believe that these amounts approximate their current fairvalues. We believe the \namounts of purchased intangible assets recorded above represent the fair values of, and approximate the amounts a market participant wouldpay for, these intangible \nassets as of January 2, 2020.The\n Asset Purchase Agreement provides for specific indemnities to us in relation to value added tax obligations and other tax reserves of certain jurisdictionswhich\n reflect  potential  tax  liabilities.  We  recognized  $64  million  of  indemnification  assets  on  the  same  basis  as  the  tax  reserves  at  January  2,  2020,  which  isrecorded\n as other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Settlements of these tax reserves, if any, will be funded by the indemnificationasset.\nThe results of the acquired operations were included in our consoli\ndated financial statements from the date of acquisition, January 2, 2020. For the period fromJanuary\n 2, 2020 through December 31, 2020, Careem contributed to a loss before income taxes of $218 million. Revenue for the period from January 2, 2020through December 31, 2020 were not ma\nterial.Cornershop\nIn\n 2019, as a strategic move of entering into grocery delivery market, we agreed to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (“Cornershop”),operating\n an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico. During 2019, we made an initial investment of $50 million (the “Initial CornershopInvestment”). The rem\naining investment was subject to antitrust approval of the countries where Cornershop operates.During\n the second quarter of 2020, we received regulatory approvals, except for Mexico. As a result, we and Cornershop amended the terms of the agreementin\n order for Uber to acquire Cornershop’s business operations, except for those in Mexico. Immediately prior to the transaction close, Cornershop was restructuredsuch\n that the Mexico operations were held in Cornershop Technologies LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary (collectively referred to as “CS-Mexico”), while allof the remaining Cornershop ope\nrations were to be held in the newly created CS-Global entity.On July\n 6, 2020, we acquired 55% controlling interest in CS-Global, an entity which held all of Cornershop’s business operations, except for those in Mexico.This\n transaction resulted in an Uber direct capital contribution of $200 million, which included the Initial Cornershop Investment and notes receivable, to CS-Global\n and a payment of $179 million to tendering shareholders, paid in a combination of cash and 2,055,038 shares of our common stock. The Initial CornershopInvestment\n was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber’s pre-acquisition ownershippercentage,\n the new value was not materially  different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at theoriginal\n $50 million. In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-Global, representing 55% ofthe\n outstanding  membership  interests.  As  a  result,  we  obtained  the  controlling  financial  interest  in  CS-Global  and  accounted  for  the  acquisition  as  a  businesscombination. Concurrent with the CS-Global acquisition\n transaction, Uber, Cornershop and CS-Global entered into a put/call arrangement over the non-controllinginterest\n in CS-Global, providing CS-Global with the right through the call option (and obligation through the put option held by Cornershop) to purchase all of theinterests\n in CS-Mexico, contingent upon the receipt of regulatory approval in Mexico (“CS-Mexico Put/Call”). Upon either the exercise of the call option (by CS-Global)\n or the put option (by Cornershop), CS-Global would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests in CS-Mexico. Uber would make a direct capitalcontribution\n to CS-Global and a payment to the tendering shareholder, totaling $94 million, in exchange for 55% outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico. TheCS-Mexico\n Put/Call, which was exercisable in 5 years if there is no IPO or liquidation event, at a future negotiated price, was accounted for separately from theacquisition, and was included in o\nther current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.137\n\n Use the content above to answer the following question:\nWhat is the estimated useful life of the developed technology intangible asset?\n\nIf the text does not contain the answer, then respond with 'I do not know'.", "question": "What is the estimated useful life of the developed technology intangible asset", "answer": "4 years"}
