"Think step by step. First consider the advertising marketplace on Uber. How big is it? Second, consider the word of mouth marketing campaign carried out by Lyft. What challenges has it faced? Finally, compare and contrast the different approaches, considering the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach.","Uber has over 170,000 advertising merchants. Lyft benefits from word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider community. It has faced significant reductions in ridership due to covid 19. Uber's diverse platform approach has including different merchants and delivery services made it more resliant to covid19 than Lyft, which suffered a drop in ridership that was not compensated by delivery.","The Uber advertising marketplace is a multi-billion dollar business. Lyft's word of mouth marketing campaign, on the other hand, is not a marketing campaign but rather the default experience for many of their users. This is a key differentiator for Lyft. Lyft's business model is designed to encourage users to share their positive experiences with friends and family, creating a self-sustaining, organic growth engine. This is in contrast to Uber's attempt to purchase the right to promote their rides in search results, which is not sustainable in the long term."

In February 2022, Lyft amended the agreement and committed to spend an aggregate of at least $350 million between February 2022 and January 2026, with a minimum of $80 million in each of the four years.
