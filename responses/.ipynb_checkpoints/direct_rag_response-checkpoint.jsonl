Our  core offering since 2012 connects drivers with riders who need to get somewhere. The scale of our network enables us to predictdemand and\n proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for driversand offer\n convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in citiesacross the United States and in s\nelect cities in Canada.•\nExpress Drive. Our  flexible car rentals program for drivers who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our requirements.Through\n our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the LyftPlatform.\n•\nLyft Rentals. In  2019, we launched Lyft Rentals to offer an attractive option for users who have long-distance trips, such as a weekend away. This is a separateconsumer offering from Exp\nress Drive.•\nLight Vehicles. We  have a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for optionsthat\n are more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. These modes can also help supplement the first-mile andlast-mile of a multimodal trip \nwith public transit.•\nPublic  Transit. Available  in  select  cities,  our  Transit  offering  integrates  third-party  public  transit  data  into  the  Lyft  App  to  offer  users  a  robust  view  oftransportation\n options around them and allows them to see transit routes to their destinations at no cost. Providing real-time public transit information is anotherstep toward providing effec\ntive, equitable and sustainable transportation to our communities, and creating a more seamless and connected transportation network.•\nLyft Autonomous. We  have a number of strategic partnerships that offer access to autonomous vehicles. Our Open Platform partnership with Motional (formerlyAptiv)\n has enabled the commercial  deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles on our platform in Las Vegas. In July 2021, we completed a multi-elementtransaction\n with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicle division, Level 5,as\n well  as  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyft  rideshare  and  fleet  data  to  accelerate  the  safety  and  commercialization  of  the  automated-drivingvehicles\n that Woven Planet is developing. In December 2021, we launched an autonomous rideshare service in Miami with Ford and Argo AI, delivering on ashared commitment to d\neploy Ford’s autonomous vehicles, powered by the Argo Self-Driving System, on our ridesharing network.We have established one of \nthe largest transportation networks in the United States and Canada. While network scale is important, we recognize that transportationhappens locally and each m\narket has its own unique user network. Our dynamic platform adjusts to the specific attributes of each market on a real-time basis.Drivers\nThe\n drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between. We workhard\n to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to be their own bosses and providing them the opportunity to focus their time on what mattersmost. Key benefits to drivers on ou\nr platform include:•\nFlexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives.•\nTechnology. Our  predictive  technology  around  ride  volume  and  demand  enables  us  to  share  key  information  with  drivers  about  when  and  where  to  drive  tomaximize their earnings on a\n real-time basis.•\nInsurance. We  procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (“TNC”) drivers against financial losses related to automobile accidents whileon the platform.\n•\nCommunity Standards. To help us uphold high  community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride booked throughthe Lyft App.\n•\nSupport. Our  Driver  Hubs  and  certain  field  locations  in  major  cities  serve  as  gathering  places  and  offer  in-person  support  and  a  personal  connection  to  Lyftemployees. In addition, driv\ners have access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals.Riders\nRiders are\n as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and from work,explore\n their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated, riders are passengers whorequest\n rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experienceevery time they open the Ly\nft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation network of choice.

Our key growth strategies include our plans to:•\nIncrease Rider Use Cases. We  are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offerproducts to\n simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services anduniversity\n safe rides programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizationsto manage the transport\nation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.•\nGrow Active Riders. We  see opportunities to continue to recoup and grow our rider base amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. We may make incrementalinvestments in our\n brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We may also offer discounts for first-time ridersto\n try Lyft or provide incentives to existing riders to encourage increased ride frequency. We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace byattracting\n and retaining more drivers on our network to deliver the best possible service levels. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand ournetwork\n coverage  beyond  the  geographies  and  markets  we  currently  serve.  We  also  believe  we  are  a  beneficiary  of  demographic  shifts,  such  as  the  growingpercentage of the U.S. population \nthat is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.•\nGrow Our Share of Consumers’ Transportation Spend. Lyft’s  transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft networkspans\n rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit and vehicle services. By integrating the fragmented transportation ecosystem, we are well positioned to deliverthe best holistic exper\nience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity.•\nDeliver  Increasing  Value  to  Drivers. We  strive  to  provide  drivers  that  use  Lyft  with  the  best  possible  experience,  including  access  to  the  best  economicopportunities. For example, throu\ngh our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We’ve also been investing in ourDriver\n Centers,  Mobile  Services  and  related  partnerships  that  offer  drivers  affordable  and  convenient  vehicle  maintenance  services.  By  making  the  driverexperience better \nand better, we can retain and attract more drivers to Lyft’s network.•\nInvest in our Marketplace Technology. Our  investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers andriders.\n Our investments in mapping, routing, payments, in-app navigation, matching technologies and data science are key to making our network more efficientand seamless to use.\n•\nThoughtfully Pursue M&A and Strategic Partnerships. In November 2018, we acquired Bikeshar e Holdings LLC (“Motivate”), the largest bike sharing platform inthe\n United States at the time and in February 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, LLC (“Flexdrive”), one of our longstanding Express Drive partners. We will continueto\n selectively  consider  acquisitions  that  contribute  to the  growth of our  current  business,  help  us expand  into  adjacent  markets  or  add new capabilities  to ournetwork.\n We believe drivers and riders will continue to benefit from a broad partner ecosystem that builds on our existing loyalty and reward programs.

As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  4,453  employees  inapproximately\n 119 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks. Approximately 40% of our employees work in our productmanagement, engineer\ning, design and science organizations. Our employees are passionate about our mission to improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.We\n believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more ouremployees\n reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2021, our employee base was 59%male\n and 39% female, and women represented 37% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 44% White, 30% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latinx,8%\n Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity information is basedon\n self-identification,  and  employees  who  did  not  disclose  their  gender  or  ethnicity  have  been  excluded  from  the  applicable  disclosure.  As  of  December  31,  2021,employees\n who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 2% oftotal U.S. employees.\nWe\n strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, developtalent\n internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We launched initiatives such as requiring all director level and above roles to consider at least one woman andone\n Black  or  Latinx  candidate  at  the  onsite  interview  stage.  We  are  continuing  to  focus  on  scaling  and  sustaining  diverse  partnerships  and  early  candidate  pipelinedevelopment as we believe \nrecruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization.One of\n the most powerful examples of Lyft’s devotion to inclusivity is our ongoing commitment to pay fairness. We conducted an annual pay equity audit for ourfifth consecutive yea\nr to assess for any systemic issues in our compensation. We worked with third party experts to conduct statistical tests on a majority of U.S. based teammembers’\n annual  salary,  equity  awards,  and  total  compensation  at  hire.  The  goal  was  to  identify  whether  any  statistically  significant  pay  differences  existed  betweendifferent\n demographic (gender and race) groups in the same band, level and job family. Where our analysis identified differences, we investigated, including looking atfactors\n not accounted for in the statistical models we used. In 2021, we did not find patterns of statistically significant pay differences for different gender or racial groupsafter accounting for legitimate b\nusiness factors like performance, experience, and location.Given continued uncertainty \nand as we recognize our remote work policy must be broadened, we have given many employees the option to work from home.None of our employees are rep\nresented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.In\n December 2020, we released our 2020 Inclusion, Diversity and Racial Equity Report, which is available on our website. We have presented this report since2017 and intend to continue to pres\nent this report to make available certain information about our diversity and inclusion efforts.Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance\nIn\n May 2021, we released our 2021 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Report, which is available on our website. We began publishing this reportin 2020 and intend to continue to pr\nepare this report annually to make available key information about our work toward environmental, social, and economic issues.Environmental\nLyft\n was founded on the belief that technology will enable us to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from the transportation system. Our vision is to rebuildcities\n around people by offering seamless access through the Lyft App to on-demand rides, public transit, and car rentals as well as lower-carbon micromobility modes. Asanother\n step in the shift from personal car ownership, we’ve also launched Lyft Pink, our premier membership program, which offers discounted pricing for rideshare,bikes, and scooters, in addition \nto perks for car rentals.We\n launched our national Resilient Streets Initiative in September 2020 and offered a vision for how cities can safely and efficiently move the greatest number ofpeople\n as economic, educational and social activities resume in our cities. The initiative reimagined what a “resilient street corridor” might look like in cities where Lyftoperates\n micromobility  services.  It  also  investigated  the  impact  of  street  design  on  key  metrics  around  vehicle  miles  traveled,  socioeconomic  demographics  and  GHGemissions.\n12\n\n            \n            Use the content above to answer the following question:\n            \n            What is the latest information on the workforce for Lyft?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n            ", "question": "What is the latest information on the workforce for Lyft?", "answer": "As of December 31, 2021, Lyft had 4,453 employees in approximately 119 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks.

This  is  in  line  with  the  Clean  Miles  Standard  and  Incentive  Program  which  was  approved  by  theCalifornia\n Air Resources Board in May 2021 and sets the target that ninety percent of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. The shift to 100%EVs\n will mean transitioning all vehicles used on the Lyft platform over the next decade to all-electric or other zero-emission technologies. This includes cars in ExpressDrive, Lyft Rentals, Lyft Autonomous, and pe\nrsonal cars used by drivers on the Lyft platform. Switching to EVs is not just good for the planet; it’s good for people – riders,drivers, and the communit\nies they serve.Social\nWe\n approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust,respect\n and a common objective of improving people’s lives by improving transportation. Through our LyftUp initiative, we’re working to enable access to affordable,reliable\n transportation for all — no matter income or zip code. We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most seriousoutstanding\n transportation gaps. Through our LyftUp programs, we partner with leading organizations, including government agencies and nonprofits, to provide access tofree and discounted car, b\nike and scooter rides to individuals and families in need. LyftUp programs included:•\nJobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job;•\nGrocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for families living in certain areas without sufficient grocery store access;•\nCommunity Grants Program - awards ride credits to hyp erlocal nonprofit organizations across the country making a difference in their communities;•\nMicromobility  Access -  provides  deeply  discounted  bikeshare  and  scooter-share  memberships  for  eligible  applicants  who  qualify  for  federal,  state  or  localassistance programs;\n•\nUniversal Vaccine Access Campaign -  mobilizes a coalition of partners to provide rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for low-income, underinsuredand at-risk communities;\n•\nDisaster Response - provides rides to access v ital services both leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies when roads are safe to do so;and\n•\nVoting Access - provides rides to the polls du ring Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such asseniors, veterans and commun\nities of color.In\n response to the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8 (“SB8”) which raised concerns that drivers could be sued simply for transporting passengers, Lyft created aDriver\n Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. We also donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood tohelp ensure\n that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. Drivers using Lyft are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Similarly, ridersshould never have to justify or sh\nare where they are going or why.Corporate Governance\nOur\n board of directors regularly evaluates our corporate governance structure and processes to help steer the company's direction and ensure it is operating withthe\n utmost business integrity.

We regularly expand ourplatform\n features, offerings and services and change our pricing methodologies. In recent periods, we have also reevaluated and changed our cost structure and focused ourbusiness\n model. Our evolving business, industry and markets make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks andchallenges we have faced o\nr expect to face include our ability to:•\nforecast our revenue and budget for and manage our expenses;•\nattract new qualified drivers and new riders and retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders in a cost-effective manner;•\ncomply with existing and new or modified laws and regulations applicable to our business;•\nmanage our platform and our business assets and expenses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures issued by various jurisdictions,including\n travel  bans,  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders,  as  well  as  maintain  demand  for  and  confidence  in  the  safety  of  our  platform  during  andfollowing the COVID-19 pandemic;\n•\nplan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future offerings, including our network of Light Vehicles or certain vehicles in the Express Driveprogram and the fleet o\nf vehicles for Lyft Rentals, and manage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to our current and future offerings;•\ndevelop, manufacture, source, deploy, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of Light Vehicles, Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, MobileServices, Lyft Auto Care, cert\nain vehicles in the Express Drive program, vehicles for Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle technology;•\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;•\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;•\neffectively manage our growth and business operations, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business;•\nsuccessfully expand our geographic reach;•\nhire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;•\nsuccessfully develop new platform features, offerings and services to enhance the experience of users; and•\nright-size our real estate portfolio.If\n we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this“Risk\n Factors” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have an evolving financial model andoperate\n in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a static financial model oroperated\n in  a  more  predictable  market.  We  have  encountered  in  the  past,  and  will  encounter  in  the  future,  risks  and  uncertainties  frequently  experienced  by  growingcompanies\n with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate ourbusiness,\n are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations could be adversely affected.Our financial performance in recent periods may not b\ne indicative of future performance, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Prior\n to COVID-19, we grew rapidly. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and the related government and public health measures, our revenue declined significantly andwe\n have since recovered partially, but our revenue remains below pre-COVID levels and the timeline for a full recovery is uncertain. Accordingly, our recent revenuegrowth\n rate and financial performance, including prior to the effects of COVID-19, the decline related to COVID-19 and recent growth rates compared to periods in themidst\n of the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, although we have achieved Adjusted EBITDA profitability ineach\n of the last three quarters, we have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we can provide no assurances that we will achieve or maintain AdjustedEBITDA profitability in the futu\nre, on a quarterly or annual basis, or that we will ever achieve profitability on a GAAP basis.19\n\n            \n            Use the content above to answer the following question:\n            \n            What operational risk factors does Lyft need to be concerned about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n            ", "question": "What operational risk factors does Lyft need to be concerned about?", "answer": "Operational risk factors that Lyft needs to be concerned about include:\n\n1.

We donot\n have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurityattacks,\n terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Wehave\n experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors,including\n infrastructure  changes, human  or software  errors,  website  hosting  disruptions  and capacity  constraints.

In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminatedor\n we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, newcloud\n infrastructure service providers.

BUSINESS\nOverview\nUber\n Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence andproduct\n expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings onour\n platform  (“platform(s)”  or  “Platform(s)”).  We  connect  consumers  (“Rider(s)”)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (“Mobility  Driver(s)”)  forridesharing\n services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (“Eater(s)”)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  “Merchants”)  with  deliveryservice\n providers  (“Couriers”)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.  Riders  and  Eaters  are  collectively  referred  to  as  “end-user(s)”  or“consumer(s).”\n Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We usethis same network, technology, ope\nrational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our\n technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (\nexcluding China and Southeast Asia).Our Segments\nAs\n of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fr\nagmented markets.Mobility\nMobility\n refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis. Mobility \nalso includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We\n believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory\n position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal\n ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven\n region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics\n firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe\n world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved\n based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category po\nsition in its respective market.Delivery\nOur\n Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered\n and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour\n Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables\n Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe\n pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform. In addition to b\nenefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve\n generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\nDuring\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (“Cornershop”) in an all-stock transaction. Theacquisition\n was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The DrizlyGroup,\n Inc.  (“Drizly”),  allowing  us to expand alcohol  offerings  in our Delivery  business  with Drizly’s  leading  platform,  technology,  scale,  and expertise.  Theacquisition\n of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination. For additional information, see Note 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item8, “Financial Statements \nand Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Freight\nWe believe that Freigh\nt is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizingindustries\n to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industryis\n highly fragmented  and deeply inefficient.  It can take several  hours, sometimes  days, for shippers to find a truck and driver  for shipments,  with most of theprocess\n conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It isequally\n difficult  for  carriers  to  find  and  book  the  shipments  that  work  for  their  businesses,  spending  hours  on  the  phone  negotiating  pricing  and  terms.  Theseinefficiencies adv\nersely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or “dead-head” miles,4\n\n            \n            Use the content above to answer the following question:\n            \n            How many countries does Uber operate in?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n            ", "question": "How many countries does Uber operate in?", "answer": "approximately 72"}

The remaining $2.5billion of the unrecogniz\ned tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.We\n recognize  accrued  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  within  the  provision  for  income  taxes  in  the  consolidated  statements  ofoperations. The amount of int\nerest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 was $12 million and $18 million, respectively.Although\n the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefitscould\n significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we areunable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognize\nd tax benefits. Any changes to unrecognized tax benefits recorded as ofDecember 31, 2021 that are r\neasonably possible to occur within the next 12 months are not expected to be material.We\n are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
