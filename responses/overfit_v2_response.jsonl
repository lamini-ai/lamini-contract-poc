{"prompt": "What was the change in percent for gross bookings for Uber between 2020 and 2021?", "question": "What was the change in percent for gross bookings for Uber between 2020 and 2021?", "answer": "We had $14.5 billion in gross bookings for 2020 and $23.7 billion in gross bookings for 2021. This represents a 62% increase in gross bookings between 2020 and 2021. We generated 72% of our gross bookings from rides in 2021 primarily through our core platforms in the United States and Canada. The remaining 28% was generated from rides in Europe and other regions. We also generated significant value from rides in our Express Drive program, as well as from rides in our luxury vehicles through our luxury services, such as the Uber Black and Uber Black Express programs. Our growth was also driven by growth in the size of our consumer base as well as by growth in the percentage of active riders who used our apps more frequently, for example, by taking additional rides. While our growth was broad-based, the composition of our growth can fluctuate and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we will achieve a particular rate of growth or that our growth will continue to be as strong as it was during the COVID-19 pandemic."}

{"prompt": "What is Lyft's growth strategy?", "question": "What is Lyft's growth strategy?", "answer": "Our Growth Strategy\nTransportation represents a massive market opportunity, one that we are in the very early stages of addressing. Our key growth strategies include:\n• Increasing Rider Use Cases. We are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. This includes expanding our offerings to address the needs of new markets, such as students, commuter fleets and businesses, and adding new services that provide value to existing riders. For example, we have launched initiatives to offer discounts to students, provide incentives to first-time riders, and develop convenient ridesharing products for businesses to deliver employees to work.\n• Growing Our Rider Base. We see opportunities to continue to increase rider usage of our current services by making it easier for people to request rides on our platforms. This includes investing in our brand and marketing consumer campaigns to increase awareness and consideration of Lyft as an option for transportation. We also believe we can continue to recoup and grow our market share in existing markets by making Lyft the preferred transportation network for our growing list of partners.\n• Expanding Our Network of Drivers. We see opportunities to continue to attract and retain more drivers on our network by offering competitive drivers’ earnings programs. We have invested in our Driver Centers, Mobile Services and related partnerships to provide drivers with easy access to the resources you need to provide good service to riders. We also believe we can grow our network of drivers by addressing the changing needs of drivers on our network, for example by expanding our offerings to help drivers make the most of their time.\n• Investing in Lyft Autonomous. Autonomous vehicles will transform the transportation landscape and we are committed to playing a leading role in this market. We have a number of strategic partnerships for the development of autonomous vehicles and have established a number of operational partnerships to deploy autonomous vehicles.\n• Acquiring or Licensing Technologies to Enhance the Passenger Experience. We are continuously looking for ways to improve the experience of drivers and riders using our platforms. This includes investing in our mapping and routing tools, in the security of our apps and in our customer service programs.\n• Geifying Our Business.

We see opportunities to grow our business by geifying our platform, i.e., applying our technology to transportation markets outside of our current footprint. We have a number of projects in place to enable inter-city travel using our"}

{"prompt": "What operational risk factors does Lyft need to be concerned about?", "question": "What operational risk factors does Lyft need to be concerned about?", "answer": "Lyft needs to be concerned about the following operational risk factors:\n1. Competition: Lyft operates in a highly competitive market for ridesharing services. New competitors may emerge, and existing competitors may invest heavily in marketing and new services to gain market share. Lyft may not be able to compete effectively with competitors who have more resources or who are better able to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences.\n2. Regulation: The ridesharing business is subject to increasing regulation by state and local governments. These regulations can impact Lyft's ability to operate its network of drivers and offer its services. For example, some jurisdictions have imposed requirements that Lyft would need to comply with in order to continue offering its current service level, such as requirements related to vehicle maintenance or background checks for drivers. New regulations could be enacted that are more restrictive of the ridesharing business model. If Lyft is unable to comply with the regulations that currently apply to it or if new regulations are enacted that are more restrictive, it may be required to make significant changes to its business operations, which could be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, changes in regulations could affect Lyft’s ability to attract and retain drivers, which could harm its business.\n3. Driver Availability and Retention: Driver availability and retention are critical to Lyft's ability to offer reliable services to its users. If Lyft is unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified drivers or if it loses existing drivers, it may not be able to offer services to all areas it serves or at all times. This could harm its ability to deliver value to users and harm its business.\n4. Technology and Infrastructure: Lyft's platform relies on complex technology and infrastructure to match drivers with riders in real-time. If Lyft is unable to maintain, upgrade or replace its technology and infrastructure when necessary, it may not be able to provide a high-quality experience for its users or support the growth of its rider base. Additionally, cyber threats to Lyft's technology and infrastructure could disrupt its operations and harm its business.\n5. Macroeconomic Factors: Lyft’s business can be affected by macroeconomic factors, such as a decline in consumer confidence or spending due to economic downturns or other factors. A decrease in consumer confidence or spending could lead to a decrease in the number of rides requested and therefore a decrease in revenue for Lyft.\n6. COVID-19 and Other Public Health Issues: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread illness, death and economic disruption. If there is another pandemic or other public health issue, it could have a material adverse effect on Lyft's business and financial condition"}

{"prompt": "What available information is there about the cash flows for Lyft?", "question": "What available information is there about the cash flows for Lyft?", "answer": "We have not generated any revenue since our inception in 2007. Our financial performance will likely be affected by our ability to generate revenue. We have a number of strategies mentioned in the risk factor section of this prospectus for attracting new users and converting them into riders. We will need to continue to invest in our brand and in marketing to maintain and grow our user base. We will also need to manage our expenses associated with the expanding network of drivers on our platform. Additionally, we will need to manage our expenses related to the growing number of rides we handle. If we are unsuccessful in attracting new users or converting them into riders, or if we are unsuccessful in managing our expenses, our business will be adversely affected. We have a number of assets and options available to us to manage our expenses, including our ability to optimize our network of drivers to decrease the number of drivers on the road at any given time and to optimize our routing options to decrease the number of miles driven by our riders. We also plan to continue to invest in our technology to improve the efficiency of our platform"}
