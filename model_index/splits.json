BUSINESS\nOverview\nUber\n Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence andproduct\n expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings onour\n platform  (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d  or  \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d).  We  connect  consumers  (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  forridesharing\n services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (\u201cEater(s)\u201d)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d)  with  deliveryservice\n providers  (\u201cCouriers\u201d)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.  Riders  and  Eaters  are  collectively  referred  to  as  \u201cend-user(s)\u201d  or\u201cconsumer(s).\u201d\n Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We usethis same network, technology, ope\nrational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our\n technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (\nexcluding China and Southeast Asia).Our Segments\nAs\n of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fr\nagmented markets.Mobility\nMobility\n refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis. Mobility \nalso includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We\n believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory\n position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal\n ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven\n region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics\n firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe\n world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved\n based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category po\nsition in its respective market.Delivery\nOur\n Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered\n and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour\n Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables\n Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe\n pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform. In addition to b\nenefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve\n generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\nDuring\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction. Theacquisition\n was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The DrizlyGroup,\n Inc.  (\u201cDrizly\u201d),  allowing  us to expand alcohol  offerings  in our Delivery  business  with Drizly\u2019s  leading  platform,  technology,  scale,  and expertise.  Theacquisition\n of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination. For additional information, see Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations included in Part II, Item8, \u201cFinancial Statements \nand Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Freight\nWe believe that Freigh\nt is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizingindustries\n to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industryis\n highly fragmented  and deeply inefficient.  It can take several  hours, sometimes  days, for shippers to find a truck and driver  for shipments,  with most of theprocess\n conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It isequally\n difficult  for  carriers  to  find  and  book  the  shipments  that  work  for  their  businesses,  spending  hours  on  the  phone  negotiating  pricing  and  terms.  Theseinefficiencies adv\nersely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,4\n", "which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automateand\n accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricingand the ability to book a shipm\nent with the touch of a button.We\n serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks,secure\n capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors representsignificant efficiency improvement\ns over traditional freight brokerage providers.During\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in an all-cash transaction, allowing us to expand our Uber Freight businessthrough\n Transplace\u2019s  expertise  in  transportation  management.  The  acquisition  of  Transplace  has  been  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination.  For  additionalinformation, see Note\n 18 \u2013 Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPlatform Synergies\nOur Platform\nThe\n foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise. Together, these elements powermovement from point A to point B.\nMassive Network\nOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers,\n as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip.In\n approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of abutton for millions, and we hope ev\nentually billions, of people.Leading Technology\nWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of ourdeep\n technology  advantage  and  include  demand  prediction,  matching  and  dispatching,  and  pricing  technologies.  Ourtechnologies make it ex\ntremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational Excellence\nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scaleproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\ncities and regulators.\nProduct Expertise\nOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provideplatform\n users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety andtrust.\nWe intend to continue to inv\nest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We\n believe  that  all  of  these  synergies  serve  the  customer  experience,  enabling  us  to  attract  new  platform  users  and  to  deepen  engagement  with  existingplatform\n users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example,Delivery\n attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to ourplatform.\n Additionally,  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  consumers  who  used  both  Mobility  and  Delivery  generated  12.6  Trips  per  month  onaverage,\n compared  to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering  in cities where both Mobility  and Delivery were offered. Webelieve that these t\nrends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With\n our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the UnitedStates as our single cross-pl\natform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priorityservice,\n and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available inselect cities\n as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for ourconsumers. We exited\n 2021 with over 6 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs. In 2020, we rolled out our\u201cSuper App\u201d view on iOS and Android, which combines our mul\ntiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers.We\n are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlockingcross-platform adver\ntising formats. During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000.Competitive Environment\nWe\n compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and inthe\n logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competitionfrom new market entrants \ngiven the low barriers to entry that characterize5\n", "these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additionalcompetition. While\n we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona\n limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan we do. The competition we fa\nce in each of our offerings includes:\u2022\nMobility.  Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the marketsthat\n we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,public\n transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.We\n also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint ventu\nre.\u2022\nDelivery.  Our  Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in  the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in  various  regions  for  drivers,consumers, and\n merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. OurDelivery offering also c\nompetes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\u2022\nFreight.  Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics,Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate\n in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,and\n regulations,  including  those  related  to  Internet  activities,  privacy,  cybersecurity,  data  protection,  intellectual  property,  competition,  consumer  protection,payments,\n labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations areconstantly\n evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations weare subject to are des\ncribed below.Mobility\nOur\n platform,  and  in  particular  our  Mobility  products,  are  subject  to  differing,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  the  numerousjurisdictions\n in  which  we  operate.  A  large  number  of  proposals  are  before  various  national,  regional,  and  local  legislative  bodies  and  regulatory  entities,  bothwithin the United States and in fo\nreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In\n the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,including\n licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,and\n regulations  while  other  jurisdictions  have  not  adopted  any  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  which  govern  our  Mobility  business.  Further,  certain  jurisdictions,including\n Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, andregulations\n banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment createssignificant complexi\nties for our business and operating model.Substantially\n all  states  in the  United  States and numerous  municipalities  in the  United  States  and around  the  world have adopted  Transportation  NetworkCompany (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations. These r\negulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their ownvehicles\n to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,background checks, vehicle insp\nections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.In\n addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California\u2019s AssemblyBill\n 5  (\u201cAB5\u201d),  which  went  into  effect  in  January  2020,  codified  a  test  to  determine  whether  a  worker  is  an  employee  under  California  law.  The  CaliforniaAttorney\n General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\n and sought  an injunction  and  monetary  damages  related  to  the  alleged  competitive  advantage  caused  by  the  alleged  misclassification  of  drivers.Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enj\noining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,the\n parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California stateballot\n initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and weexpect that Drivers will be able\n to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to complywith\n the provisions of Proposition 22. See the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A and \u201cNote 15 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to ourconsolidated financia\nl statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.6\n", "In addition, many jurisdictions have municipal bodies that adopted and will adopt regulations that govern our business. For example:\u2022\nIn London, Transport for London (\u201cTfL\u201d) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November2019,\n TfL  declined  to  issue  us  a  license,  finding  that  we  were  not  \u201cfit  and  proper,\u201d  including  with  respect  to  confidence  in  our  change  and  releasemanagement\n processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license onlargely the same condi\ntions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.\u2022\nSince April 2019, Mexico City\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operationalrequirements,\n including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC datasharing\n requirement  and  a  requirement  that  Drivers  in  Mexico  City  obtain  additional  licenses  and  annual  vehicle  inspections  to  provide  ridesharingservices.\n Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification,could have a negative impact on\n our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operatein Mexico City.\n\u2022\nIn January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait timesbefore riders could be pi\ncked up by ridesharing drivers. In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product.\u2022\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a capon\n the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard fortime\n and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers on\n our platform. As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services onour\n platform  that  went  into  effect  on  January  1,  2021,  and  other  jurisdictions  have  in  the  past  considered  or  may  consider  regulations  which  wouldimplement\n minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislativeor regulatory initia\ntives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.See\n the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significantcomplexities for our busin\ness and operating model.As we continue to expand our offerings, we \nmay be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.Data Privacy and Protection\nOur\n technology  platform,  and  the  user  data  we  collect  and  process  to  run  our  business,  are  an  integral  part  of  our  business  model  and,  as  a  result,  ourcompliance\n with  laws  dealing  with  the  collection  and  processing  of  personal  data  is  core  to  our  strategy  to  improve  platform  user  experience  and  build  trust.Regulators\n around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing ofpersonally\n identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Twoexamples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the Europea\nn Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a lawwhich went into effect in\n May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the CaliforniaConsumer\n Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirementsfor\n covered  businesses.  U.S.  state,  city,  and  foreign  regulators  are  expected  to  continue  proposing  and  adopting  significant  laws  impacting  the  processing  ofpersonally\n identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November2020 (effective in Janua\nry 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.Payments and Financial Services\nMost\n jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, UberPayments\n B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  as  an  electronic  money  institution  in  support  of  certain  payment  activities  in  the  European  Economic  Area  (the\u201cEEA\u201d).\n Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtainlicenses\n to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such lawscould\n affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals inseveral other jurisdi\nctions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.Antitrust\nCompetition\n authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are do\ning so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as7\n", "the  EU,  the  United  States,  Brazil,  and  India,  particularly  surrounding  issues  of  predatory  pricing,  price-fixing,  and  abuse  of  market  power.  In  addition,governmental\n agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significantfines\n or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations onour contractual rel\nationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.Intellectual Property\nWe\n believe  that  our  intellectual  property  is  essential  to  our  business  and  affords  us  a  competitive  advantage  in  the  markets  in  which  we  operate.  Ourintellectual\n property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs,registered and unregist\nered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.To\n protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,and disclosure restrictions.\n Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights asappropriate.\n We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,and distribution of, our propri\netary information in a commercially prudent manner.Research and Development\nBecause\n the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon ourability\n to  ensure  a  continual  and  timely  flow  of  competitive  new  offerings  and  technologies.  We  continue  to  develop  new  technologies  to  enhance  existingofferings\n and  services,  and  to  expand  the  range  of  our  offerings  through  research  and  development  (\u201cR&D\u201d)  and  acquisition  of  third-party  businesses  andtechnology.\nSeasonality\nMobility\nWe typically generate higher\n revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typicallygenerate\n lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in North America andEurope. We have typically \nexperienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of theCOVID-19\n pandemic  and  related  restrictions,  which  altered  typical  travel  patterns.  We  expect  that  seasonality  will  eventually  return  to  its  historic  patterns  asrecovery from the pande\nmic continues.Delivery\nWe\n typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although thehistorical\n growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and relatedrestrictions, which acc\nelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.Human Capital at Uber\nEmployees\nWe\n are  a  global  company  and  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  and  our  subsidiaries  had  approximately  29,300  employees  globally  and  operations  inapproximately\n 72  countries  and  approximately  10,500  cities  around  the  world.  Our  human  capital  strategies  are  developed  and  managed  by  our  Chief  PeopleOfficer, who reports to the CEO, and ar\ne overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.Our\n success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are often subject\n to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.Adapting\n to  a  New  Way  of  Working.  In  2021,  the  ever-evolving  COVID-19  pandemic  continued  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  our  employees  and  ourworkforce management st\nrategy and caused us to continually adapt how we work. As a result of COVID-19, in 2020, we asked that all employees who were able todo\n so work remotely and while we subsequently announced return to office dates, the dynamic COVID situation disrupted our return to office plans\u2014althoughmany\n of our offices are open, we have not yet set an updated return to office date. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced newdynamics\n into the households of many of our employees. As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stressand\n social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  The  issues  of  stress  and  balance  were  particularly  exacerbated  among  caregivers  of  youngchildren.\n To address some of these concerns, we strengthened our work-from-home policies and looked for new ways to support our employees as they navigatedthis crisis in their pe\nrsonal and professional lives. We provided8\n", "more attention and flexibility to caregivers by providing resources, tools, and support, and amplified our focus on mental health and well-being.Employee Engagement\n.  To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging andare able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need thro\nugh employee engagement surveysand\n related  tools.  We  historically  conducted  a  semi-annual  workforce  survey  that  measures  employee  engagement,  overall  satisfaction,  and  well-being.  But  in2021,\n we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month. We use the results ofthese regular checks to\n better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, andgrowth\n opportunities. For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was createdbased\n on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operationsthrough monitoring metri\ncs such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.Employee\n Development  and  Retention.  We  believe  that  employees  who  have  opportunities  for  development  are  more  engaged,  satisfied,  and  productive.Employees are empowered to d\nrive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uberthrough\n internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enablethem\n to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promotewellness\n and  productivity.  This  helps  our  diverse  employee  base  manage  life\u2019s  expected  and  unexpected  events.  Globally,  Uber  offers  competitive  benefitspackages to our employees and \ntheir families. We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique populations.For\n additional discussion, see the risk factor titled \u201c\u2014Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, futureattrition,\n or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our2021 People and Culture Report, which is ava\nilable on our website. The information in the 2021 People and Culture report is not a part of this Form 10-K.Diversity and Inclusion\nWe\n believe  that  great  minds  don\u2019t  think  alike,  and  we  work  hard  to  ensure  that  people  of  diverse  backgrounds  feel  welcome  and  valued.  We  encouragedifferent\n opinions  and  approaches  to  be  heard,  and  then  we  come  together  and  build.  We  believe  that  when  employees  feel  empowered  to  succeed  in  a  workenvironment\n that celebrates,  supports, and invests in diversity,  progress follows. To achieve  our objective  to increase  diversity  in who we hire, we implementprocesses\n throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women,LGBTQIA+ individuals, people\n with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadershiproles come from historically \nunderrepresented groups.Our\n Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensationpackages of our most senior ex\necutives.We\n encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber\u2019s People Team or theIntegrity Helpline.\nAs\n a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially. To dothat,\n we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.In\n July 2020, we announced 14 commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have taken action to move these commitments forward.Some of our commitments to \nanti-racism include:\u2022\nRidding our platform of racism\u2022\nFighting racism with technology\u2022\nSustaining equity and belonging for all\u2022\nDriving equity in the communityFor\n more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2021 People and Culture Report and our 2021 ESG Report, which areavailable on our website. The \ninformation in these reports is not a part of this Form 10-K.Driver and Courier Well-Being\nIn\n addition  to  employees  discussed  above,  our  business  also  depends  on  our  ability  to  attract  and  engage  Drivers,  consumers,  Merchants,  shippers,  andCouriers, as well as contrac\ntors and consultants that support our global operations.In\n relation  to  those  individuals  who  earn  income  on  our  platform,  Uber  is  one  of  the  largest  open  platforms  for  work  in  the  world,  providing  accessible,flexible work in approxima\ntely 72 countries. Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created9\n", "through its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,traditional employm\nent. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain availableto anyone who chooses platform-bas\ned work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible,\n flexible,  independent  work  has  offered  an  option  for  many  workers  historically  marginalized  from  the  labor  market  and  has  enabled  widegeographic\n coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using anapp to connect with work opportuniti\nes. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generallypatchy\n compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker iseither\n an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. AtUber,\n we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovativeways to address these issues.\n\u2022\nAdvocacy:  We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all workshould\n be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and otherapp\n based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples ofour advocacy to preserve f\nlexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\u25e6\nIn  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  onpolicymakers,\n platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having accessto protections and benefi\nts doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.\u25e6\nIn California, we welcomed  the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements  for platform companies  like Uber to providebenefits, including heal\nthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.\u25e6\nIn the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant tothis\n change, drivers who use Uber\u2019s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paidholiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also annou\nnced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an evenstronger voice to drivers \nand to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\u2022\nProtections  and benefits:  We  partner  with  leading  insurance  companies  around  the  world  to  pioneer  protections  for  independent  workers,  includingimplementing addition\nal protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.\u2022\nEarnings:  We  are  continually  developing  new  technology  that  Drivers  can  use  to  acquire  information  that  may  help  them  save  on  costs  and  makeinformed choices about wher\ne and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\u2022\nProgression:  We  have  partnered  with  Arizona  State  University  to  offer  eligible  Drivers  and  their  family  members  access  to  over  100  undergraduatedegree\n programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship. Through our partnership with Arizona State University, over4,000 Drivers and their fami\nly members have enrolled in an undergraduate degree program.\u2022\nEngagement:  We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform. We believe thatthe\n best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Driversto participate\n in meaningful dialogue with us. In markets across the world, we hold regular meetings with Driver associations and conduct regular surveysto gather feedback on our app, ou\nr support services, and other matters.For\n additional discussion, see the risk factor titled \u201c\u2014If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers, whether\n as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adverselyimpacted.\u201d\n included  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  as  well  our  2021  ESG  Report  and  our  2021  People  and  Culture  Report.

RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors\n may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the followingrisks,\n together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis o\nf Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and the relatednotes\n included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K.  Any  of  the  following  risks  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,operating\n results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment.Our business, financial condition, operat\ning results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently donot believe are material.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse eff\nect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of ourbusiness.\n\u2022\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\u2022\nThe  mobility,  delivery,  and  logistics  industries  are  highly  competitive,  with  well-established  and  low-cost  alternatives  that  have  been  available  fordecades, low barriers to en\ntry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\u2022\nTo remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,and may continue to offer, s\nignificant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\u2022\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the fo\nreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\u2022\nIf we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform wi\nll become less appealing to platform users.\u2022\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage andnegative\n publicity  regarding  our  brand  and  reputation,  and  while  we  have  taken  significant  steps  to  rehabilitate  our  brand  and  reputation,  failure  tomaintain and enhance our b\nrand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\u2022\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address thesechallenges may not be succ\nessful.\u2022\nIf  we  are  unable  to  optimize  our  organizational  structure  or  effectively  manage  our  growth,  our  financial  performance  and  future  prospects  will  beadversely affected.\n\u2022\nPlatform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which mayharm our ability to at\ntract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.\u2022\nWe  are  making  substantial  investments  in  new  offerings  and  technologies,  and  may  increase  such  investments  in  the  future.  These  new  ventures  areinherently risky, and we may nev\ner realize any expected benefits from them.\u2022\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected byeconomic, social, weathe\nr, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.11\n", "\u2022We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or suchtechnologies\n may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered bycompetitors or non-autonomous v\nehicles.\u2022\nOur  business  depends  on  retaining  and  attracting  high-quality  personnel,  and  continued  attrition,  future  attrition,  or  unsuccessful  succession  planningcould adversely affec\nt our business.\u2022\nWe may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary orconfidential data, employee \ndata, or platform user data.\u2022\nCyberattacks,  including  computer  malware,  ransomware,  viruses,  spamming,  and  phishing  attacks  could  harm  our  reputation,  business,  and  operatingresults.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adverselyimpacted.\n\u2022\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise,including those bey\nond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\u2022\nWe  rely  on  third  parties  maintaining  open  marketplaces  to  distribute  our  platform  and  to  provide  the  software  we  use  in  certain  of  our  products  andofferings. If such third pa\nrties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adverselyaffected.\n\u2022\nWe will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\u2022\nIf  we  are  unable  to  successfully  identify,  acquire  and  integrate  suitable  businesses,  our  operating  results  and  prospects  could  be  harmed,  and  anybusinesses we acq\nuire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\u2022\nWe may continue  to be blocked from or limited  in providing or operating  our products and offerings  in certain  jurisdictions,  and may be required  tomodify our business model in those \njurisdictions as a result.\u2022\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\u2022\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\u2022\nWe face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation,fines, legislative and \nregulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\u2022\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property ofothers, we may incur signifi\ncant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\u2022\nThe  market  price  of  our  common  stock  has  been,  and  may  continue  to  be,  volatile  or  may  decline  steeply  or  suddenly  regardless  of  our  operatingperformance,\n and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paidand may lose all or part o\nf your investment.Risks Related to Our Business\nGeneral Economic Risks\nThe\n coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impactour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn\n March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus,various\n governments  around  the  world  have  implemented,  lifted,  and  in  some  regions  reinstated  travel  restrictions,  business  restrictions,  school  closures,limitations on social o\nr public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, forexample,\n by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions are being lifted andmany regions around\n the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility offering may not recoverto\n pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have beenand\n may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict when Driver supply levels will return to pre-pandemiclevels.\n Additionally, the recent surge of COVID-19 primarily related to the rise of the Omicron variant in many markets in the United States and globally hasaffected\n and may continue to affect, among other things, travel and result in other COVID-19 related advisories and restrictions and may adversely affect bothDriver supply and consumer demand \nfor our Mobility offering. In addition, certain U.S. jurisdictions have issued emergency orders that require us to cap12\n", "fees charged to merchants on Delivery. Furthermore, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally for approximatelyone year, and our shared rides o\nffering continues to be temporarily suspended in many regions.Furthermore,\n as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we asked that all employees who are able to do so work remotely, and while we have since re-openedcertain\n offices and announced a hybrid return-to-office  plan for employees, plans to return to the office may be negatively impacted by ongoing spread of theCOVID-19\n virus, including positive tests for COVID-19 among some personnel who voluntarily returned to the office; these and any future instances of positiveCOVID-19\n tests of personnel working in our offices, as well as continued widespread remote work arrangements could have a negative impact on our operations,the\n execution of our business plans, and productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, and of third-partyservice\n providers who perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by theoutbreak\n and related governmental actions. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees\u2019 ability towork\n remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote workingmay also\n result in privacy, cybersecurity and fraud risks, and our understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance fromregulatory\n authorities in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, may be subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves inresponse to future developm\nents.We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by launchi\nng new, or expanding existing, services, features, or health and safety requirements on an expeditedbasis,\n particularly those relating to delivery of food and other goods. Our understanding of applicable privacy, consumer protection and other legal and regulatoryrequirements,\n as  well  as  the  latest  guidance  from  regulatory  authorities  in  connection  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  may  be  subject  to  legal  or  regulatorychallenge, particularly\n as regulatory guidance evolves in response to future developments. In addition, our launch of new, or expanding existing, services, features,or\n health  and  safety  requirements  in  response  to  COVID-19  may  heighten  other  risks  described  in  this  \u201cRisk  Factors\u201d  section,  including  our  classification  ofDrivers. These challenges cou\nld result in fines or other enforcement measures that could adversely impact our financial results or operations.The\n COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has requiredand\n may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing modelsof\n our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we donot\n believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,and results of operations.\n The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including theduration of the spread of th\ne outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, theadministration,\n adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supplychains,\n foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to ourend-users\u2019\n behaviors,  all  of  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  be  predicted.  Moreover,  even  after  shelter  at  home  orders  and  travel  advisories  are  lifted,demand\n for our Mobility offering may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict when and if our Mobility offering will return to pre-COVID-19 demand levels.\nIn\n addition,  we  cannot  predict  the  impact  the  COVID-19 pandemic  will  have  on  our  business  partners  and  third-party  vendors,  and  we  may  be  adverselyimpacted as\n a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19pandemic\n have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capitalmarkets.\n To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the otherrisks\n described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, couldadversely impact our busin\ness, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.Operational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Driv\ners were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.The\n classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  We  areinvolved\n in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative\n agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers\n or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist),  rather  than  as  independent  contractors.  We  believe  that  Drivers  are  independent  contractors  because,among other\n things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, andprovide a vehicle to per\nform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.Furthermore, the costs associated with\n defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classificationof Drivers have been and may con\ntinue to be material to our business.In addition, more than 150,000 Drive\nrs in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or13\n", "expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority ofthese\n Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, we areinvolved\n in  numerous  legal  proceedings  regarding  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements  entered  into  with  Drivers.  If  we  are  not  successful  in  suchproceedings,\n this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on ourbusiness and financial condi\ntion.Changes\n to  foreign,  state,  and  local  laws  governing  the  definition  or  classification  of  independent  contractors,  or  judicial  decisions  regarding  independentcontractor\n classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers\n by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought\n litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral,\n in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\n and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. InAugust 2020,\n the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe\n pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court\u2019s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the \ninjunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In\n November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours\n for independent  work. Proposition 22 went into  effect  in December  2020 and we expect  that Drivers  will  be able  to maintain  their  status as independentcontractors\n under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminar\ny injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the ef\nfective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We\n face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging\n that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay\n be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,\n we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated\n with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity\n contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however,\n we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not haveadequate\n Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof\n the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effec\nt on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another\n example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.  Uber  B.V.,  et  al.  ruling  by  theEmployment\n Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan\n self-employed).  Subsequent  to the  UK Supreme  Court\u2019s  ruling,  we announced  that  we will  treat  all  UK drivers  as \u201cworkers\u201d  under  UK labor  law, goingforward.\n Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday\n pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relatio\nnship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme\n Court  that  reclassified  an  UberX  Driver  as  an  employee  (which  has  been  followed  by  inconsistent  appellate  decisions  regarding  employee  status),decisions\n by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish\n regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the mea\nning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In\n addition,  reclassification  of  Drivers  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist,  have  and  could  lead  to  groups  of  Driversbecoming\n represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number ofDrivers\n were  to  become  unionized  and  collective  bargaining  agreement  terms  were  to  deviate  significantly  from  our  business  model,  our  business,  financialcondition,\n operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disruptour operations and reduce our n\net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.In\n addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentationincluding\n revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCriticalAccounting\n Estimates\u201d  included  in  Part  II,  Item  7  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  and  Note  1  in  the  section  titled  \u201cNotes  to  the  Consolidated  FinancialStatements\u201d included in Pa\nrt II, Item 8 of this Annual Report14\n", "on Form 10-K.The\n mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, lowbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every\n major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in theseindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely i\nmpacted.Our\n platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly\n fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada\n from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto\n entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity toshift\n to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and othermerchants\n have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume oforders; and shippers and car\nriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.Further,\n while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona\n limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan\n we  do.  As  we  and  our  competitors  introduce  new  products  and  offerings,  and  as  existing  products  evolve,  we  expect  to  become  subject  to  additionalcompetition.\n In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers\n value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate  our products. Increased competitioncould\n result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of ourplatform, and our margins.\nWe face competit\nion in each of our offerings, including:\u2022\nMobility .  Our  Mobility  offering  competes  with  personal  vehicle  ownership  and  usage,  which  accounts  for  the  majority  of  passenger  miles  in  themarkets\n that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. Inaddition,\n public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option inmany\n cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, includingLyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi jo\nint venture.\u2022\nDelivery .  Our Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in various  regions  for  Drivers,consumers,\n and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.Our\n Delivery  offering  also  competes  with  restaurants,  including  those  that  offer  their  own  delivery  and/or  take-away,  meal  kit  delivery  services,grocery delivery services,\n and traditional grocers.\u2022\nFreight.  Our  Freight  offering  competes  with  global  and  North  American  freight  brokers  such  as  C.H.  Robinson,  Total  Quality  Logistics,  XPOLogistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Tr\nansfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.Many\n of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer discounted services, Driver incentives, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative products andofferings, and alterna\ntive pricing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than those that we offer. Further, some of our current or potential competitorshave, and\n may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier bases in a particular geographicmarket.\n In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operatinghistories,\n larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respondmore\n quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which mayrender\n our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may share in the effective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals andlitigation victori\nes we may achieve, without having to incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.We\n are contractually restricted from competing with our minority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including in China throughAugust\n 2023, Russia/CIS through February 2025, Southeast Asia through the later of March 2023 or one year after we dispose of all interests in Grab, India withrespect\n to meal delivery through January 2023, and the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and certain parts of Europe with respect to e-bikes and e-scooters\n through May 2023, while none of our minority-owned affiliates are restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world. Didi currently competeswith us\n in certain countries in Latin America and in Australia. In addition, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture currently competes with us in certain countries in Europeand\n Africa. As Didi and our other minority-owned affiliates continue to expand their businesses, they may in the future compete with us in additional geographicmarkets. In addition, we ar\ne contractually restricted from competing with some of our15\n", "majority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including competing against Uber Freight with respect to freight brokerage.Additionally,\n if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our acquisitions, we may not ultimately consummate such acquisitions or may consummatethem\n only in jurisdictions where antitrust approval is obtained. Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all orpart of our or the targe\nt company\u2019s operations or agree to other remedies. Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.For\n all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our inability to compete effectively wouldhave an adverse effec\nt on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.To\n remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, andmay\n continue  to  offer,  significant  Driver  incentives  and  consumer  discounts  and  promotions,  which  has  adversely  affected  and  may  continue  to  adverselyaffect our financial performance.\nTo\n remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or servicefees, and we have\n offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets,we\n have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives aDriver\n receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets andregions,\n we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discountsand\n promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts andpromotions\n will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and willcontinue to negatively affect,\n our financial performance. Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have beenmodified\n over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricingmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Driver\ns. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see inthe\n application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to successfully manage these andsimilar kinds of changes in \nthe future, our business may be adversely impacted.The markets in which we compet\ne have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitorswill\n continue  to  be  highly  capitalized.  Moreover,  certain  of  our  stockholders,  including  SoftBank  (a  large  stockholder),  have  made  substantial  investments  incertain\n of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors inthe\n future.  These investments  or strategic  transactions,  along with other competitive  advantages  discussed above, may allow our competitors  to compete  moreeffectively\n against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers,merchants,\n shippers,  and  carriers  to  their  platform  and  away  from  ours.  Such  competitive  pressures  may  lead  us  to  maintain  or  lower  fares  or  service  fees  ormaintain\n or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relativelynascent, and we can\nnot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.We\n have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the foreseeabl\ne future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.We have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating lo\nsses of $8.6 billion, $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31,2019,\n 2020 and 2021, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $23.6 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levelsand\n decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, wemay not be able to maintain\n or increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses,as we\n continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts,and\n promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hireadditional employees; and\n add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed inincreasing\n our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increaserevenue or\n contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect toadd\n value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lowerservice\n fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in anegative\n take  rate  with  respect  to  those  transactions  after  considering  amounts  collected  from  consumers  and  paid  to  Drivers.  As  we  expand  our  offerings  toadditional\n cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve ormaintain\n profitability  in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize  the operating efficiencies  we expect toachieve as a result of ou\nr acquisition of Careem and Postmates, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in16\n", "the United States, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, atleast in the near term.\nIf\n we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform will become \nless appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.Our\n success  in  a  given  geographic  market  significantly  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  or  increase  our  network  scale  and  liquidity  in  that  geographicmarket\n by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, orelect\n to offer them through a competitor\u2019s  platform, we may lack a sufficient  supply of Drivers to attract  consumers  and merchants  to our platform.  We haveexperienced and expect \nto continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have beenand may continue to\n be impacted by concerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a givenmarket,\n we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network effect that weexperience in that\n market. Similarly, if carriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficientsupply\n of carriers in specific geographic markets to attract shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in aspecific\n geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, wemay\n lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offeringwill\n become less appealing to consumers and merchants. A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurantgroups\n and  other  merchants,  and  this  concentration  increases  the  risk  of  fluctuations  in  our  operating  results  and  our  sensitivity  to  any  material  adversedevelopments experienced by our significant restaurant partners.\n If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lacksufficient\n opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of ourplatform.\n An insufficient supply of platform users would decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we maybenefit\n from having larger network scale and liquidity than some competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcomeby\n smaller competitors. Maintaining a balance between supply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may bemore\n important  to  service  quality  than  the  absolute  size  of  the  network.  If  our  service  quality  diminishes  or  our  competitors\u2019  products  achieve  greater  marketadoption, our competitors m\nay be able to grow at a quicker rate than we do and may diminish our network effect.Our\n number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operationof\n our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Driversand\n merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand,including\n as  a  result  of  safety  incidents  and  corporate  reporting  related  to  safety,  perceived  political  or  geopolitical  affiliations,  a  pandemic  or  an  outbreak  ofdisease or similar public health concern, such as the current CO\nVID-19 pandemic, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has notfundamentally\n changed,  dissatisfaction  with  changes  we  make  to  our  products  and  offerings,  or  dissatisfaction  with  our  products  and  offerings  in  general.  Inaddition,\n if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptablemanner,\n our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers do not establish ormaintain\n active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-qualitysupport,\n or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, our revenue would decline, and ourbusiness would suffer.\nThe\n number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide theirservices\n through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms orservices,\n and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or otheraspects\n of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similarwork,\n we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives toimprove our financial p\nerformance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.Often,\n we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likelybe\n viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and securitybreaches,\n including  terminating  access  to  our  platform  for  users  with  low  ratings  or  reported  incidents,  and  imposing  certain  qualifications  for  Drivers  andmerchants,\n which  may  damage  our  relationships  with  platform  users  or  discourage  or  diminish  their  use  of  our  platform.  Further,  we  are  investing  in  ourautonomous\n vehicle  strategy,  which  may  add  to  Driver  dissatisfaction  over  time,  as  it  may  reduce  the  need  for  Drivers.  Driver  dissatisfaction  has  in  the  pastresulted\n in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protestsmay\n result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce ournetwork liquidity, and which in turn \nmay cause a further decline in platform usage.17\n", "Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm ourfuture operating results.\nIn addition, changes in\n Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers toour\n platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,prosecutors, taxicab owners, and cons\numers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to makedeliveries\n through  Delivery,  our  qualification  and  background  check  standards  are  generally  less  extensive  than  the  standards  for  Drivers  who  are  eligible  toprovide\n rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materiallydifferent\n type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in anefficient\n manner,  which  could  be  costly  and  time-consuming.  Required  changes  in  the  qualification,  screening,  and  background  check  process  (including  anychanges\n to  such  processes  of  Careem,  Postmates  or  other  acquired  companies)  could  also  reduce  the  number  of  Drivers  in  those  markets  or  extend  the  timerequired\n to  recruit  new  Drivers  to  our  platform,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business  and  growth.  Furthermore,  we  rely  on  a  single  background-checkprovider in certain\n jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms orat\n all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Driversundergoing periodic background ch\necks that are required to continue using our platform.Maintaining\n and  enhancing  our  brand  and  reputation  is  critical  to  our  business  prospects.  We  have  previously  received  significant  media  coverage  andnegative\n publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintainor enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\nMaintaining\n and  enhancing  our  brand  and  reputation  is  critical  to  our  ability  to  attract  new  employees  and  platform  users,  to  preserve  and  deepen  theengagement\n of our existing  employees and platform users, and to mitigate  legislative  or regulatory scrutiny, litigation,  government investigations,  and adverseplatform user sentiment.\nWe\n have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueleddistrust\n of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made itdifficult\n for  us  to  attract  and  retain  platform  users,  reduces  confidence  in  and  use  of  our  products  and  offerings,  invites  continued  legislative  and  regulatoryscrutiny,\n and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital,increased their inves\ntments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.In 2019, we\n released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to haveoccurred on\n our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safetyincidents claimed to h\nave occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continueto\n result  in  positive  and  negative  media  coverage  and  increased  regulatory  scrutiny  and  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation  with  platform  users.  Furtherunfavorable\n media  coverage  and  negative  publicity  could  adversely  impact  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects.  As  our  platform  continues  to  scale  andbecomes\n increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation couldhave\n an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates andCornershop, have\n or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harmto their brands could advers\nely impact our brand and reputation.Our\n brand  and  reputation  might  also  be  harmed  by  events  outside  of  our  control.  For  example,  we  have  licensed  our  brand  in  connection  with  certaindivestitures\n and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certaincontractual\n protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,and consumers may not be\n aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality ofservice,\n are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage andour\n reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently,our business.\nWhile\n we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining agood\n reputation,  minimizing  the  number  of  safety  incidents,  continuing  an  improved  culture  and  workplace  practices,  improving  our  compliance  programs,maintaining a high quali\nty of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, andmedia\n strategies  have  involved  significant  costs  and  may  not  be  successful.  We  anticipate  that  other  competitors  and  potential  competitors  will  expand  theirofferings,\n which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain ourbrand\n in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand andreputation would be further d\namaged and our business may suffer.18\n", "Our  historical  workplace  culture  and  forward-leaning  approach  created  operational,  compliance,  and  cultural  challenges,  and  a  failure  to  address  thesechallenges would adversely impact our business, financia\nl condition, operating results, and prospects.Our historical workplace culture and\n forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may inthe\n future  continue  to  harm,  our  business  results  and  financial  condition.  Our  prior  failure  to  prioritize  compliance,  has  led  to  increased  regulatory  scrutinyglobally.\n Although we have since made changes in our company\u2019s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment topromote\n transparency  and  collaboration,  regulators  may  continue  to  perceive  us  negatively,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial  condition,operating results, and prospe\ncts.Our historical\n workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing,causing misalignment and inefficiencies\n in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these effortsmay\n not be successful. Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated ormanaged\n to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions. Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, suchreorganizations may not b\ne successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our company.Our workforce and\n operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020. If weare\n unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and futureprospects will be adversely af\nfected.Since\n our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business andhas\n placed,  and  will  continue  to  place,  significant  strain  on  our  management,  personnel,  operations,  systems,  technical  performance,  financial  resources,  andinternal\n financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affectour operating results.\nAs\n our  operations  have  expanded,  we  have  grown  from  159  employees  as  of  December  31,  2012  to  approximately  29,300  global  employees  as  ofDecember\n 31, 2021, of whom approximately 12,300 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside theUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Pr\noperly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,including\n engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our newhires\n perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining ourexisting employees and\n staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions inworkforce\n and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductionsin\n workforce.  Any  reduction  in  workforce  or  restructuring  may  yield  unintended  consequences  and  costs,  such  as  attrition  beyond  the  intended  reduction  inworkforce, the\n distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficultfor\n us  to  hire  new  employees  in  the  future  and  increase  the  risk  that  we  may  not  achieve  the  anticipated  benefits  from  the  reduction  in  workforce.  Properlymanaging\n our growth or any reductions  in workforce  will  require  us to establish  consistent  policies  across regions  and functions,  and a failure  to do so couldlikewise harm our business.\nOur\n failure  to  upgrade  our  technology  or  network  infrastructure  effectively  to  support  our  growth  could  result  in  unanticipated  system  disruptions,  slowresponse times,\n or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improvethe\n technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controlsover\n financial  reporting,  we  will  be  required  to  commit  substantial  financial,  operational,  and  technical  resources.  In  particular,  we  will  need  to  improve  ourtransaction\n processing  and  reporting,  operational,  and  financial  systems,  procedures,  and  controls.  For  example,  due  to  our  significant  growth,  especially  withrespect to\n our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolvingrisks\n of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our currentand\n planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hireadditional\n qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, orcarriers,\n platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors\u2019 platforms, which would adversely affectour business, financial condi\ntion, and operating results.Our organizational structure is\n complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, shippers, employees, productsand\n offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well asour\n reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and maturein\n these  areas.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage  the  growth  of  our  business,  the  quality  of  our  platform  may  suffer,  and  we  may  be  unable  to  addresscompetitive chall\nenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.19\n", "If platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability to attractand\n retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financialcondition, and operating results.\nWe\n are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or otherwise, and we may be unableto protect\n or provide a safe environment for Drivers and consumers as a result of certain actions by Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, and third parties. Suchactions\n may  result  in  injuries,  property  damage,  or  loss  of  life  for  consumers  and  third  parties,  or  business  interruption,  brand  and  reputational  damage,  orsignificant\n liabilities for us. Although we administer certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers throughthird-party\n service providers, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in certainjurisdictions\n according  to  national  and  local  laws,  and  our  third-party  service  providers  may  fail  to  conduct  such  background  checks  adequately  or  discloseinformation\n that  could  be  relevant  to  a  determination  of  eligibility.  Further,  the  qualification  and  background  check  standards  for  Couriers  are  generally  lessextensive\n than those conducted for Mobility Drivers. In addition, we do not independently test Drivers\u2019 driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue toreceive\n complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have also faced civillitigation\n alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety ofour platform.\nIf Drivers or\n carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform asa conduit for criminal activity, consumers and shippers may not con\nsider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result ofour\n business relationship with such Driver or carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents andallegations\n worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwiseengaging\n in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct whileusing\n our  platform,  Drivers  and  merchants  may  be  unwilling  to  continue  using  our  platform.  In  addition,  certain  regions  where  we  operate  have  high  rates  ofviolent\n crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports ofDrivers\n and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. Ifother\n criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may beharmed, and our business and finan\ncial results could be adversely affected.Public\n reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,whether generated by us or thi\nrd parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.Further,\n we  may  be  subject  to  claims  of  significant  liability  based  on  traffic  accidents,  deaths,  injuries,  or  other  incidents  that  are  caused  by  Drivers,consumers,\n or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, wemay\n face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. Inaddition, the\n growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable roadusers\n and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved oruneven\n roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitanareas, need\n to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours,all of which heighten the potential risk\n of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which weare\n exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase ouroperating\n costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significantcosts in investigating and de\nfending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may\n increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherentlyrisky, and we may never realize any expec\nted benefits from them.We have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologie\ns, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing newtechnologies, tools,\n features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in severalcountries including\n Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,which operates an\n on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. We also plan to invest significantresources\n to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our developmentbudget\n efficiently  or  effectively  on  commercially  successful  and  innovative  technologies,  we  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits  of  our  strategy.  Our  newinitiatives\n also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or noprior development or oper\nating experience. Because such20\n", "offerings  and  technologies  are  new,  they  will  likely  involve  claims  and  liabilities  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  personal  injury  claims),  expenses,  regulatorychallenges, and other risks, so\nme of which we do not currently anticipate.There\n can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiativeswill gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated \nwith these new investments. It isalso\n possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development effortswith\n respect to new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from ourmore\n established products, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or technologies, regulatory authorities maysubject\n us  to  new  rules  or  restrictions  in  response  to  our  innovations  that  could  increase  our  expenses  or  prevent  us  from  successfully  commercializing  newproducts, offerings\n or technologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospectsmay be harmed.\nOur\n business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have limited experience, and if we areunable to manage the risks presented by our business model internat\nionally, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely impacted.As\n of December 31, 2021, we operated in approximately 72 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for approximately 78% of all Trips.We have\n limited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside of the United States and have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments toexpand\n our international operations and compete with local and other global competitors. For example, our acquisitions of Careem and Cornershop may not besuccessful and may negativ\nely affect our operating results.Conducting\n our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we do not face to the samedegree in the United States. Th\nese risks include, among others:\u2022\noperational and compli ance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;\u2022\nthe  resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptationof our operations to local p\nractices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations;\u2022\nlaws  and  regulations  more  restrictive  than  those  in  the  United  States,  including  laws  governing  competition,  pricing,  payment  methods,  Internetactivities,\n transportation  services  (such  as  taxis  and  vehicles  for  hire),  transportation  network  companies  (such  as  ridesharing),  logistics  services,payment\n processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening andbackground\n checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information,ownership of intellectua\nl property, and other activities important to our business;\u2022\ncompetition with companies or other  services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existingrelationships with potenti\nal platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets;\u2022\ndiffering levels of soc ial acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;\u2022\ndiffering levels of t echnological compatibility with our platform;\u2022\nexposure to business cultures in whi ch improper business practices may be prevalent;\u2022\nlegal  uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or alack of clear legal precedent;\n\u2022\ndifficulties  in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of laborunions, employee represent\native bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;\u2022\nfluctuations in curren cy exchange rates;\u2022\nmanaging operations in ma rkets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;\u2022\nregulations governing the  control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in thesame currencies, as wel\nl as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\u2022\nadverse  tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation ofearnings;\n\u2022\nincreased financia l accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;21\n", "\u2022difficulties  in  implementing  and  maintaining  the  financial  systems  and  processes  needed  to  enable  compliance  across  multiple  offerings  andjurisdictions;\n\u2022\nimport and export restr ictions and changes in trade regulation;\u2022\npolitical,  social, and economic instability abroad, war, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general, and societal crime conditions that harm ordisrupt the global economy and\n/or can directly impact platform users;\u2022\npublic  health concerns or emergencies,  such as the current COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable  diseases  or viruses, outbreaks ofwhich have from time to t\nime occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate; and\u2022\nreduced or varied protectio n for intellectual property rights in some markets.These risks could adversely a\nffect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We have limited influence ov\ner our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.Our\n growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering withand\n investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategyhas\n also  included  the  divestment  of  certain  lines  of  businesses  in  its  entirety,  and  not  just  in  certain  jurisdictions,  and  instead  partnering  and  investing  in  ourcompetitors\n in  those  lines  of  businesses.  As  a  result,  a  significant  portion  of  our  assets  includes  minority  ownership  positions,  including  in  Didi,  Grab,  ourYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lim\ne, Zomato and Aurora.Our ownership\n in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors ofDidi\n or Zomato, and therefore we do not participate in the day-to-day management of Didi or Zomato or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi andZomato.\n We are not represented on the management teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day\n management  of  Grab,  our  Yandex.Taxi  joint  venture,  Lime  or  Aurora.  Although  we  are  represented  on  each  of  the  boards  of  directors  of  Grab,  ourYandex.Taxi\n joint venture, Lime and Aurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams ofthese\n companies  may  make  decisions  or  take  actions  with  which  we  disagree  or  that  may  be  harmful  to  the  value  of  our  ownership  in  these  companies.Additionally, these\n companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in variousmarkets throughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our owner\nship interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results,and prospects would be adversely a\nffected by such expansion into markets in which we operate.Any\n material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of theseassets\n is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affectsuch\n valuations.  To the extent  these businesses are or become publicly traded  companies, volatility  or fluctuations  in the stock price of such companies couldadversely\n impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companieshave\n limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limitedpublic information\n is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particulareconomic,\n tax,  political,  legal,  safety,  regulatory  and  public  health  risks,  including  the  extent  of  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  on  their  business;  aredomiciled\n or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and effortsof a small group of individuals, and, as a\n result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect onthe\n relevant company\u2019s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitivepositions.\n Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operatingresults, or the trading pr\nice of our common stock.Further,\n we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora\u2019s November 2021 initial publicoffering, we\n are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Other than Aurora, Grab, Didi and Zomato, there is currently no public market forany of these securities, and there may be no market\n in the future if and when we decide to sell such assets. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at atime\n at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment companyunder\n the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we wouldnot\n be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets.Accordingly, we may never rea\nlize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.We\n may  experience  significant  fluctuations  in  our operating  results.  If  we are unable  to achieve  or sustain  profitability,  our  prospects  would  be adverselyaffected and investors may lose so\nme or all of the value of their investment.22\n", "Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety offactors,\n some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.For\n Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, andtypically\n generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certaincities, such as Paris. We\n have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as aresult\n of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in ourrevenue\n in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  compared  to  the  second  and  third  quarters,  although  the  historical  growth  of  Delivery  has  masked  these  seasonalfluctuations;\n however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth ofDelivery\n in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficultto\n detect.  We  expect  these  seasonal  trends  to  become  more  pronounced  over  time  as  our  growth  slows.  Other  seasonal  trends  may  develop  or  these  existingseasonal\n trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results mayfluctuate as a result of\n factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability toexpand\n our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pacewith\n technological  changes  in  the  industries  in  which  we  operate,  changes  in  governmental  or  other  regulations  affecting  our  business,  harm  to  our  brand  orreputation,\n and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base ourexpense\n levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expensesand\n investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed ourexpectations.\n If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of theirinvestment.\nIf\n our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial resultsand future prospects.\nOur\n Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that theywill continue to slow in the future.\n We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic andour ability to:\n\u2022\ngrow supply and demand on our platform; \u2022\nincrease existing pla tform users\u2019 activity on our platform;\u2022\ncontinue to introduce our pl atform to new markets;\u2022\nprovide high-quality support to Dr ivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;\u2022\nexpand our business and increase ou r market share and category position;\u2022\ncompete with the products and o fferings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\u2022\ndevelop new products, offerings, and technologies;\u2022\nidentify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;\u2022\npenetrate suburban and rur al areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\u2022\nreduce  the  costs  of  our  Mobility  offering  to  better  compete  with  personal  vehicle  ownership  and  usage  and  other  low-cost  alternatives  like  publictransportation, which in many \ncases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\u2022\nmaintain existing loc al regulations in key markets where we operate;\u2022\nenter  or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy,Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and\n\u2022\nincrease positive per ception of our brand.We\n may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemmingfrom\n continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrierdemand,\n whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees invarious\n jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adverselyimpacted.\n We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will notachieve profitability.\n23\n", "We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in largemetropolitan\n areas  or  ability  to  provide  trips  to  and  from  airports  are  negatively  affected,  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects  would  be  adverselyimpacted.\nIn\n 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Pauloin Brazil, and London in the United Kingd\nom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentivesand\n consumer  discounts  and  promotions  in  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  As  a  result  of  our  geographic  concentration,  our  business  and  financial  results  aresusceptible\n to  economic,  social,  weather,  and  regulatory  conditions  or  other  circumstances  in  each  of  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  Outbreaks  of  contagiousdiseases\n or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas inwhich we operate. Any short-term o\nr long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemicsor\n pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,or\n regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greaterdegree than\n would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affectour\n ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renewexisting\n licenses  or  do  not  receive  new  licenses  in  key  metropolitan  areas  where  we  operate  or  such  licenses  are  terminated,  any  inability  to  operate  in  suchmetropolitan\n area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.\nIn\n addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap onthe\n number  of  new  vehicle  licenses  issued  to  drivers  who  offer  for-hire  services.  In  December  2018,  New  York  City  implemented  a  per-mile  and  per-minuteminimum trip payment \nformula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers\n on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financialperformance\n in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharingtrips\n in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle havepassed, or\n may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providingservices\n on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network issmaller\n and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetratingsuburban\n and  rural  areas,  or  if  we  are  unable  to  operate  in  certain  key  metropolitan  areas  in  the  future,  our  ability  to  serve  what  we  consider  to  be  our  totaladdressable market would be \nlimited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.In 2021,\n we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, ouroperating\n results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and fromairports.\n In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to andfrom\n airports. Sustained declines in air travel  due to COVID-19, or other travel-related  health concerns,  could continue to suppress demand for airport-relatedMobility\n and  reduce  our  Mobility  Gross  Bookings  from  airport  trips.  Certain  airports  currently  regulate  ridesharing  within  airport  boundaries,  including  bymandating\n that  ridesharing  service  providers  obtain  airport-specific  licenses,  and  some  airports,  particularly  those  outside  the  United  States,  have  bannedridesharing\n operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking therequisite\n permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, againstus or\n Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt ouroperations.\n In  addition,  if  drop-offs  or  pick-ups  of  riders  become  inconvenient  because  of  airport  rules  or  regulations,  or  more  expensive  because  of  airport-imposed fees,\n the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While wehave\n entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airportboundaries,\n we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similaragreements with airpor\nts in all jurisdictions.If\n we  fail  to  offer  autonomous  vehicle  technologies  on  our  platform  or  fail  to  offer  such  technologies  on  our  platform  before  our  competitors,  or  if  suchtechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those\n offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be ad\nversely impacted.We\n have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on ourplatform.\n For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investmentin the\n combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesh\naring24\n", "network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomousvehicles\n present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired),\n Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey\n will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.  Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing\n fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous\n vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their tech\nnology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith\n which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould\n adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing,\n delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers\n on our platform. If a significant  number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our financial  performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.\nAutonomous vehicle technologies \ninvolve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicletechnologies\n that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liabilityfor\n us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,and operating results.\nFederal\n and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. Theseregulations\n could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,we\n may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existin\ng or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substant\nial fines or penalties.Our\n business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business.\nOur\n success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are\n often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace\n practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our\n employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,which\n includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintainin\ng our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability toattract\n employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remotework,\n as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand\n feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicit\ny could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future\n leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee\n turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives andemployees required for \nthe planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.In\n addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We haveentered\n into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our businessdifferently than me\nmbers of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,operations, or business plans. We \nmay not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.In addition, our failure \nto put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transitioninto new\n roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults.\n The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personneltransitions\n has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person\u2019s skills, knowledge of our business, andyears\n of industry experience. If we cannot effectively  manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future businessprospects could be adversely \naffected.To\n attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to attract and retain the personnelwe require to operate our bus\niness effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract,25\n", "retain,  and  motivate  employees  may  not  be  as  effective  as  in  the  past,  particularly  if  the  value  of  the  underlying  stock  does  not  increase  commensurate  withexpectations\n or  consistent  with  our  historical  stock  price  growth.  If  we  are  unable  to  attract  and  retain  high-quality  management  and  operating  personnel,  ourbusiness, financial condit\nion, and operating results could be adversely affected.The impact of economic conditions, inc\nluding the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.Our\n performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic condition\ns, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets,\n taxation,  energy  prices,  interest  rates,  consumer  confidence,  and  other  macroeconomic  factors.  Consumer  preferences  tend  to  shift  to  lower-costalternatives\n during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone\n of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation\n alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand\n may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants\n in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is gene\nrally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending atmany\n of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand\n offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportuni\nties for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inf\nlation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.Factors\n such  as  inflation,  increased  fuel  prices,  and  increased  vehicle  purchase,  rental,  or  maintenance  costs,  including  increased  prices  of  new  and  usedvehicle\n parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.Similarly,\n factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  food  costs,  increased  labor  and  employee  benefit  costs,  increased  rental  costs,  and  increased  energy  costs  mayincrease merchant\n operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs arebeyond the\n control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or toseek\n alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likelycause\n order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipmentson\n our  platform  to  decline.  A  decreased  supply  of Drivers,  consumers,  merchants,  shippers,  or carriers  on our  platform  would  decrease  our  network  liquidity,which could harm our business and oper\nating results.If\n we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietaryor confidential data, employee da\nta, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.We\n collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers\u2019 licensenumbers\n and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information. As such, we are anattractive\n target of data security attacks by third parties. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure,alteration or\n destruction of, any such data could result in significant liability and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation andbrand,\n a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business. We rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwiseprocess\n some of our data and that of platform users, and any failure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use,acquisition, disclosure, a\nlteration, or destruction of, such information could have similar adverse consequences for us.Because\n the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often unrecognizableuntil\n launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative measures. Our servers and platform may bevulnerable\n to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not detect. Individuals able to circumvent our security measuresmay\n misappropriate  confidential,  proprietary,  or  personal  information  held  by  or  on  behalf  of  us,  disrupt  our  operations,  damage  our  computers,  or  otherwisedamage\n our business. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches,including potential li\nability that may not be limited to the amounts covered by our insurance.Security\n breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmentalinvestigation.\n We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in May 2014, we experienced a datasecurity\n incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information  belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that anemployee had unintentiona\nlly posted publicly on a26\n", "code-sharing  website  used  by  software  developers  (the  \u201c2014  Breach\u201d).  In  October  and  November  of  2016,  outside  actors  downloaded  the  personal  data  ofapproximately\n 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the \u201c2016 Breach\u201d). The accessed data included the names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers,and drivers\u2019 license numb\ners of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information on this incident, see the risk factors titled \u201c\u2014Wecurrently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and reque\nsts for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices, and other U.S. andforeign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which co\nuld harm our business\u201d and \u201c\u2014We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, andother processing of data,\n which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy anddata\n protection  practices,\u201d  below.  As  we  expand  our  operations,  we  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breaches  experienced  by  the  companies  we  acquire.  Forexample, in\n April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed accessto\n certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other datasecurity\n breaches,  or  if  we  fail  to  remediate  this  or  any  other  data  security  breach  that  Careem  or  we  experience,  we  may  face  harm  to  our  brand,  businessdisruption, and significant \nliabilities.If\n we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we mayfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operat\ning results would be adversely affected.To\n continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the developmentof new\n products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. Forexample, in\n January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider\n destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independenc\ne of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.Developing\n and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends\n on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any suchnew\n or  upgraded  products,  offerings,  or  features  may  not  work  as  intended  or  may  not  provide  intended  value  to  platform  users.  For  example,  some  productchanges\n in  California  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,  reduced  demand  for  rides  and  reduced  supply  of  Drivers  on  our  platform,  Driverdissatisfaction, and\n adverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, orif\n platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which wouldadversely affect our op\nerating results.We\n track  certain  operational  metrics  and  our  category  position  with  internal  systems  and  tools,  and  our  equity  stakes  in  minority-owned  affiliates  withinformation\n provided  by  such  minority-owned  affiliates,  and  do  not  independently  verify  such  metrics.  Certain  of  our  operational  metrics  are  subject  toinherent challenges in measurement, and real or perce\nived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.We\n track certain  operational  metrics, including key metrics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position, with internal systems andtools,\n and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, that are not independently verified by anythird\n party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions onwhich\n we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which couldresult\n in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose, or our estimates of our category position. If the internal systems and toolswe\n use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. Whilethese\n numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges inmeasuring\n how  our  products  are  used  across  large  populations  globally.  For  example,  we  believe  that  there  are  consumers  who  have  multiple  accounts,  eventhough\n we prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to howwe\n measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-termstrategies. If our operating metrics\n or our estimates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate representations ofour\n business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates of our category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates to beaccurate,\n or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial resultscould be adversely affected.\nIn\n certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, andsafety concerns. If we do not succes\nsfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or otheradverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and\n Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allowconsumers\n to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).In 2021, cash-paid trips accoun\nted for approximately 7% of our global27\n", "Gross  Bookings.  This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.  The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  ourtechnology\n raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash forridesharing\n and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significantfines\n and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use ofcash\n with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent orfatal attacks, and other\n criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers whileusing\n our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which couldadversely impact our busin\ness.In\n addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue\n to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit thecash\n received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are notalways\n effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and wecannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Furt\nher, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect toa\n variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systemsfail,\n we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Suchcollection\n failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,impact our financial performance.\nLoss or material modification of our cr\nedit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by eithe\nr credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantlylimit\n our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry(\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard\n (the \u201cStandard\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developedby the\n PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and othernetwork\n operating  rules could result  in fines or restrictions  on our ability  to accept payment  cards. Under certain circumstances  specified in the payment cardnetwork\n rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities mayreveal\n that  we  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  Standard.  If  an  audit,  self-  assessment,  or  other  test  determines  that  we  need  to  take  steps  to  remediate  anydeficiencies,\n such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,even if we comply with the Standa\nrd, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt newoperating\n rules  or  interpret  existing  rules  that  we  or  our  processors  might  find  difficult  or  even  impossible  to  follow,  or  costly  to  implement.  In  addition  toviolations\n of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receiveincentives\n from  them,  could  increase  our  costs,  or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business.  The  loss  of  our  credit  card  acceptance  privileges  for  any  one  of  thesereasons, or\n the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue,and operating results.\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spa\nmming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.We\n rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms andmobile\n payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the informationtechnology systems of our\n third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data,including\n sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware,viruses,\n spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreatsare\n constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticatedcyberattacker, such as\n a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security ofour\n systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitiveposition,\n result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adverselyaffect our reputat\nion, business and operating results.Various other\n factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy,issues\n with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, orbreaches\n in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gainaccess\n to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effectivemanner, they could result \nin adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the28\n", "number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we havedeveloped,\n and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirableactivities\n on  our  platform,  and  security  breaches,  we  cannot  guarantee  that  such  measures  will  provide  absolute  security.  Our  efforts  on  this  front  may  beunsuccessful\n as  a  result  of,  for  example,  software  bugs  or  other  technical  malfunctions;  employee,  contractor,  or  vendor  error  or  malfeasance;  governmentsurveillance;\n or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure tomaintain\n the  performance,  reliability,  security,  and  availability  of  our  products,  offerings,  and  technical  infrastructure  to  the  satisfaction  of  platform  users  andcertain\n regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business,and our decreased abili\nty to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors \ncould adversely affect our business.Our\n platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependentupon our\n ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in thefuture\n contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in oursoftware,\n third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactionsbetween\n systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact theavailability of\n our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future thatcould\n result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control,such\n as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platformusers\n may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, ourrelease\n of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Anyerrors,\n bugs,  or  vulnerabilities  discovered  in  our  code  or  systems  after  release  could  result  in  an  interruption  in  the  availability  of  our  platform  or  a  negativeexperience\n for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to ourreputation,\n loss of platform  users, loss of revenue  or liability  for  damages,  regulatory  inquiries,  or other  proceedings,  any of which could  adversely  affect  ourbusiness\n and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks.AI\n algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial datapractices by us or others cou\nld impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine thedecisions,\n predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, andbrand or reputational harm.\nWe are subject to climate \nchange risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adverselyimpacted.\nWe\n face  climate  change  related  physical  and  transition  risks,  which  include  the  risk  of  market  shifts  toward  electric  vehicles  (\u201cEVs\u201d)  and  lower  carbonbusiness\n models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and durationof\n extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-partysuppliers,\n and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs tomaintain\n or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% ofvehicle\n miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Driversmay be\n subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adoptedin\n London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent weexperience Driver supply cons\ntraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.We\n have  made  climate  related  commitments  that  require  us  to  invest  significant  effort,  resources,  and  management  time  and  circumstances  may  arise,including those beyond our control, that may require us to revis\ne the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.We\n have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to netzero\n climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct setsenvironmental\n standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towardsour\n climate  commitments  requires  us  to  invest  significant  effort,  resources,  and  management  time,  and  circumstances  may  arise,  including  those  beyond  ourcontrol,\n that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability todedicate\n resources  to make the progress on our climate  commitments  that we initially  anticipated.  In addition, our ability to meet our climate  commitments  isdependent on external fa\nctors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related29\n", "interpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the availability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charginginfrastructure\n that can be efficiently  accessed by Drivers. Any failure to meet  regulatory requirements  related  to climate  change, or to meet our stated climatechange\n commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand,reputation, and consequently, ou\nr business.Dependencies on Third Parties\nThe\n successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under ourcontrol.\nOur\n business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internetinfrastructure\n or  GPS  signals  or  the  failure  of  telecommunications  network  operators  to  provide  us  with  the  bandwidth  we  need  to  provide  our  products  andofferings have interfered, and could continue to\n interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attemptto\n access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, andmay\n use our competitors\u2019 products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunicationsoperators.\n If  mobile  Internet  access  fees  or  other  charges  to  Internet  users  increase,  consumer  traffic  may  decrease,  which  may  in  turn  cause  our  revenue  tosignificantly decrease.\nOur\n business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as apower\n outage,  telecommunications  delay  or  failure,  security  breach,  or  computer  virus  could  result  in  delays  or  interruptions  to  our  products,  offerings,  andplatform,\n as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services,and\n local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, andsubject\n us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop newproducts\n to  mitigate  the  impact  of  potential  interruptions  to  mobile  communications  systems,  which  can  be  used  by  consumers  in  territories  where  mobilecommunications systems a\nre less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.We\n rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings.If such third parties interfere with the distr\nibution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.Our\n platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available fordownload.\n We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaceswill not\n charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users\u2019 permission to track their activities acrossthird-party\n apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness ofsuch\n advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users onour platform.\n We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is criticalto\n the functionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offerour\n platform in all of the markets in which we operate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it ispossible\n that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do notprovide access to such softwar\ne on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we maybe\n required  to  seek  comparable  software  from  other  sources,  which  may  be  more  expensive  or  inferior,  or  may  not  be  available  at  all,  any  of  which  wouldadversely affect our bus\niness.Our business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across de\nvices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.One\n of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Ourplatform\n is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and Android. We depend on the accessibility of our platformacross\n these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and wemay\n not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability,whether due to actions of thi\nrd parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business.We\n rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party elements become unavailable orunavailable on favorable terms, our business could be advers\nely affected.The\n convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business. We rely on third parties forelements\n of our payment-processing infrastructure to remit payments to Drivers, merchants, and carriers using our platform, and these third parties may refuse torenew\n our agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us onacceptable terms o\nr at all, our business may be30\n", "disrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and other processing and gateway fees, and such feesresult\n in significant  costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure  to pay increased  fees to banks to process funds, and there  is noassurance that such online payment providers will not\n pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us. If these fees increase over time, our operatingcosts will increase, which cou\nld adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.In\n addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, and havecaused\n substantial  Driver  dissatisfaction  and  generated  a  significant  number  of  Driver  complaints.  Future  failures  of  the  payment  processing  infrastructureunderlying\n our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment operations and could cause them to instead use our competitors\u2019 platforms. If the qualityor\n convenience  of  our  payment  processing  infrastructure  declines  as  a  result  of  these  limitations  or  for  any  other  reason,  the  attractiveness  of  our  business  toDrivers,\n merchants,  and  carriers  could  be  adversely  affected.  If  we  are  forced  to  migrate  to  other  third-party  payment  service  providers  for  any  reason,  thetransition would require sign\nificant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.We\n currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any interruptions or delays in servicesfrom these third parties could impair \nthe delivery of our products and offerings and harm our business.We\n use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do not control the physicaloperation\n of  any  of  the  co-located  data  centers  we  use  or  the  operations  of  our  third-party  service  providers.  These  third-party  operations  and  co-located  datacenters\n may  experience  break-ins,  computer  viruses,  denial-of-service  attacks,  sabotage,  acts  of  vandalism,  and  other  misconduct.  These  facilities  may  also  bevulnerable\n to  damage  or  interruption  from  power  loss,  telecommunications  failures,  fires,  floods,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  tornadoes,  and  similar  events.  Oursystems\n do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party serviceproviders\n to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or requireus\n to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service. This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss ofdata, any of\n which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switchto\n another  cloud or data center  provider in the event of any disruptions  or interference  to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data centerproviders are subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and o\nur co-located data center facilitieshave\n no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities oncommercially\n reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center isarranged.\n Interruptions in the delivery of our products and offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and carriers to stop offering their servicesthrough\n our  platform,  and  reduce  use  of  our  platform  by  consumers  and  shippers.  Our  business  and  operating  results  may  be  harmed  if  current  and  potentialDrivers,\n consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers believe our platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computationalcapacity\n sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised,which would have an adverse effe\nct on our growth and business.Our use of third-party open source software could adversely a\nffect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to possible litigation.We\n use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that use third-party open sourcesoftware have faced claims challenging the use of such open source soft\nware and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may besubject\n to  suits  by  parties  claiming  ownership  of  what  we  believe  to  be  open  source  software,  or  claiming  non-compliance  with  the  applicable  open  sourcelicensing\n terms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open sourcesoftware to make available\n all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designedto monitor our\n compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete opensource\n license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicableterms\n of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number ofopen-source\n software  license  types,  almost  none  of  which  have  been  tested  in  a  court  of  law,  resulting  in  a  dearth  of  guidance  regarding  the  proper  legalinterpretation\n of such licenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publiclyrelease certain po\nrtions of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.In\n addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source\n licensors  generally  do  not  provide  warranties  or  controls  on  the  functionality  or  origin  of  the  software.  Use  of  open  source  software  may  also  presentadditional security risks because the public availability of such soft\nware may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise ourplatform.\n Additionally,  because  any  software  source  code  that  we  make  available  under  an  open  source  license  or  that  we  contribute  to  existing  open  sourceprojects becomes public\nly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we31\n", "would be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business,financial condition, or op\nerating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.Financing and Transactional Risks\nWe will require additional capital \nto support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.To\n continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings,and markets. If we raise \nadditional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution,and\n any  new  equity  securities  we  issue  may  have  rights,  preferences,  and  privileges  superior  to  those  of  existing  stockholders.  Certain  of  our  existing  debtinstruments\n contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness andother\n financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, ourexisting\n debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financingon\n favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to supportour business growth and to respond to business ch\nallenges and competition may be significantly limited.We\n have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness maylimit the funds available to us, and the ter\nms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.As\n of December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $238 million ofCareem\n Convertible  Notes  remain  subject  to  future  issuance  to  Careem  stockholders  as  of  December  31,  2021.  Subject  to  the  limitations  in  the  terms  of  ourexisting and future indebt\nedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may needto incur additional debt \nto finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.We\n may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments willreduce\n the funds available  to us for  working capital,  capital  expenditures,  and other  corporate  purposes and limit  our ability  to obtain  additional  financing  forworking\n capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten ourvulnerability\n to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business andthe\n industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cashflow\n from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness,or\n to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generatecash from operating ac\ntivities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.In\n addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations,including\n limitations  on  incurring  additional  indebtedness  and  liens,  limitations  on  certain  consolidations,  mergers,  and  sales  of  assets,  and  restrictions  on  thepayment\n of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raisingactivities\n and  other  financial  and  operational  matters,  which  may  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  obtain  additional  capital  to  pursue  business  opportunities,including\n potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit ourability to obtain addit\nional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.In addition, we are exposed to\n interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section titled \u201cManagement'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condit\nion and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.\u201dWe may have exposure to materiall\ny greater than anticipated tax liabilities.The\n tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different companies. For example, wemay\n become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many othermultinational\n corporations,  we are  subject  to tax  in multiple  U.S. and foreign  jurisdictions  and have structured  our operations  to reduce  our effective  tax  rate.Currently,\n certain  jurisdictions  are  investigating  our  compliance  with  tax  rules.  If  it  is  determined  that  we  are  not  compliant  with  such  rules,  we  could  oweadditional taxes.\nCertain jurisdictions, including Australia,\n Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowedto\n contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those mattersare being litigated. This prepayment of\n contested taxes is referred to as \u201cpay-to-play.\u201d Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subjectto such taxes; even when such paymen\nts32\n", "are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collectingthe payment will be requi\nred to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.Additionally, the taxing autho\nrities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies forvaluing developed technology, whic\nh could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our futureincome\n taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions\n that  have  higher  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  allowance  on  our  U.S.  and  Netherlands'  deferred  tax  assets,  or  changes  in  tax  laws,regulations, or accounting p\nrinciples. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, andcurrently\n face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financialposition\n and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment byour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertai\nn. The ultimate tax outcome may differ fromthe amounts\n recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Ourtax\n positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future,which\n could  impact  our  financial  position.  In  addition,  in  connection  with  any  planned  or  future  acquisitions,  we  may  acquire  businesses  that  have  differinglicenses\n and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm\u2019s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than ourlicenses\n and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certainjurisdictions\n or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financialstatements, and could adve\nrsely affect our financial results.Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely aff\nect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.We\n are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and modified in2020,\n has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and regulations promulgated in connection therewith remainunclear\n in  many  respects  and  could  be  subject  to  potential  amendments  and  technical  corrections,  as  well  as  interpretations  and  incremental  implementingregulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the\n \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. Inaddition,\n it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting poi\nnt for computing state and local tax liabilities.We\n are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness.\n Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat\n we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stock\nholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potentialchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations\n, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We couldbecome\n subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmentalbodies\n could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted andhistorically\n applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our taxobligations\n in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expandingscale\n of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm ourfinancial position, oper\nating results, and cash flows.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other \ntax attributes may be limited.As\n of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and$12.4\n billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January1,\n 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,we\n also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating losscarryforwards\n depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset futureincome\n tax  liabilities,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  In  addition,  under  Sections  382  and  383  of  the  IRC,  if  a  corporationundergoes\n an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019sability\n to use its pre-change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset itspost-change\n income  may  be  limited.  Many  U.S. states  follow  similar  rules  for  restricting  use  of  tax  attributes  after  an  ownership  change.  We  may  experienceownership\n changes  in  the  future  because  of  subsequent  shifts  in  our  stock  ownership.  As  a  result,  if  we  earn  net  taxable  income,  our  ability  to  use  our  pre-ownership\n change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, whichcould potentially resul\nt in increased future tax liability to us.33\n", "We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Because\n we conduct a significant  and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies  other than the U.S. dollar  but report  our consolidatedfinancial\n results  in  U.S.  dollars,  we  face  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  currency  exchange  rates.  As  exchange  rates  vary,  revenue,  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  ofdepreciation\n and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affectour\n overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activitymay not\n completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we havelimited\n experience  establishing  hedging  programs,  which  could  expose  us  to  additional  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition  and  operatingresults.\nIf\n we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesseswe acquire may not perform as expected or b\ne effectively integrated.As\n part of our business strategy,  we have entered  into, and expect  to continue  to enter  into, agreements  to acquire  companies,  form joint ventures,  divestportions or aspects of our business, s\nell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies, including ourYandex.Taxi\n joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of SK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem, Cornershop, Postmates,Drizly and\n Transplace. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify atarget\n for  acquisition,  we  may  not  be  able  to  complete  the  acquisition  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  we  may  not  be  able  to  receive  approval  from  theapplicable competi\ntion authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.Further,\n negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.We\n may  expend  significant  cash  or  incur  substantial  debt  to  finance  such  acquisitions,  and  such  indebtedness  may  restrict  our  business  or  require  the  use  ofavailable\n cash  to  make  interest  and  principal  payments.  In  addition,  we  may  finance  or  otherwise  complete  acquisitions  by  issuing  equity  or  convertible  debtsecurities,\n which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluateand\n execute  acquisitions  or  other  strategic  transactions  successfully  or  fail  to  successfully  address  any  of  these  risks,  our  business,  financial  condition,  andoperating results may be h\narmed.In\n addition,  any  businesses  we  acquire  may  not  perform  as  well  as  we  expect.  Failure  to  manage  and  successfully  integrate  acquired  businesses  andtechnologies,\n including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results andexpansion\n prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policiesregarding\n data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, anddoing\n so  may  cause  our  relationships  with  government  authorities  in  certain  jurisdictions  to  suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessingsignificant\n fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. The process of integrating an acquiredcompany, business, or technology or a\ncquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:\u2022\ndiverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;\u2022\ndisrupting our ongoing business operat ions;\u2022\nplatform user accep tance of the acquired company\u2019s offerings;\u2022\nimplementing or rem ediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;\u2022\nintegrating the acqui red business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;\u2022\nretaining  and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees, managing culturaldifferences\n between  acquired  businesses  and  our  business,  as  well  as  managing  costs  associated  with  eliminating  redundancies  or  transferringemployees on acceptabl\ne terms with minimal business disruption;\u2022\nmaintaining importan t business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;\u2022\nintegrating the brand id entity of an acquired company with our own;\u2022\nintegrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;\u2022\nliability for pre- acquisition activities of the acquired company;\u2022\nlitigation or other c laims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and\u2022\nimpairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.We have in the past and may \nin the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company\u2019s operating functions. For example,with respect to the integ\nration of Careem and Drizly, each company\u2019s brand, product app(s) and34\n", "payments apps continue to operate in parallel with Uber\u2019s apps and each company\u2019s engineering, human resources, and operations teams will continue to operateindependently\n and report to such company\u2019s own Chief Executive Officer. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisitionand our brand and reputation cou\nld be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company\u2019s brand.In\n addition,  our  acquisition  of  Careem  has  increased  our  risks  under  the  U.S. Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (\u201cFCPA\u201d)  and  other  similar  laws  outside  theUnited\n States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not proveeffective, and such par\nties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.We\n may not receive  a favorable  return  on investment  for  prior  or future  business  combinations,  and we cannot  predict  whether  these  transactions  will  beaccretive\n to  the  value  of  our  common  stock.  It  is  also  possible  that  acquisitions,  combinations,  divestitures,  joint  ventures,  or  other  strategic  transactions  weannounce\n could  be  viewed  negatively  by  the  press,  investors,  platform  users,  or  regulators,  any  or  all  of  which  may  adversely  affect  our  reputation  and  ourbusiness. Any of these factors may \nadversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe may continue to be blocked from or l\nimited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify ourbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.\nIn\n certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model hasbeen\n blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in suchjurisdictions.\n In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk\n revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going\n basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not \u201cfit and proper,\u201dincluding with\n respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt\n granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person. Two new conditions(which\n we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Anyinability\n to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,\n and  operating  results.  We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities\n to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019, MexicoCity\u2019s\n Secretar\u00eda  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  aprohibition\n on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  arequirement that Driv\ners in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection,we\n have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such \nregulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab \nand car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto\n comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019,\n we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked\n up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented\n a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew\n York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave\n had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted\n to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle\n licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust\n 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruisingcap,\u201d\n intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although\n such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measur\ne to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton\n January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. Inaddition,\n in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1,\n 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate\n for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted incountries outside the United St\nates. If other35\n", "jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.In certain\n jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or thatwe\n believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations\n altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness\n operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers whoused\n the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges\n and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial\n performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat\n we  violated  local  competition  laws.  In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in\n Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain\n of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings\n or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision tocontinue\n operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of thispractice\n and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses\n or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue\n to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decisionas\n a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers\u2019  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore,\n such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely\n affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave\n favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications. In\n addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing\n with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate inaccordance with our\n business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required tocomply with regulatory and oth\ner requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an advers\ne impact on our business and future prospects.As\n of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.  We  are  subject  to  differing,  andsometimes conflict\ning, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national,regional,\n and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our businessmodel.\n Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting howwe\n operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may beadopted.\nFurther,\n existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws andregulations,\n and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency  medicaltransportation, we\n may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market\n in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit\n or block our ability  to offer  our products to Drivers and consumers  in those jurisdictions,  thereby impeding overall  use of our platform. We are activelychallenging\n some  of  these  laws  and  regulations  and  are  lobbying  other  jurisdictions  to  oppose  similar  restrictions  on  our  business,  especially  our  ridesharingservices. Further,\n because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or\n emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for\n polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effectin April\n 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto\n electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California tohave\n been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require usto share\n certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordancewith\n these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app in Egypt oneither a temporary o\nr indefinite basis.Additionally, effectiv\ne January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), an event commonly36\n", "referred to as Brexit. The UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.In\n addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe\n application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers,\n including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto,\n among  other  things,  transportation,  competition,  advertising,  consumer  protection,  fee  calculations,  personal  injuries,  privacy,  intellectual  property,  productliability,\n discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the SupremeCourt of\n Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regionsof\n Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegatio\nns, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial\n damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould\n harm our ability  to operate  our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions  in which we operate,  which could adversely  affect  our business,revenue, and operating resu\nlts.In\n addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters throug\nh our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery\n and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan\n that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app coul\nd result in negativepublicity, market withdr\nawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competit\nion laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition\n authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, incl\nuding governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues\n of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof\n anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices aretoo\n high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour\n business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.  Further,  any  new  requirements  or  restrictions,  or  proposed  requirements  or  restrictions,  could  result  in  adversepublicity or fines, whether o\nr not valid or subject to appeal.In\n addition,  governmental  agencies  and  regulators  may,  among  other  things,  prohibit  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  or  combinations  we  plan  to  make,impose\n significant  fines  or penalties,  require  divestiture  of  certain  of our  assets,  or impose  other  restrictions  that  limit  or require  us to modify  our operations,including\n limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we dobusiness\n and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financialcondition, or operating resu\nlts.We\n expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focuson\n the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of aninvestigation\n or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limitour future acquisitions, div\nestitures, operations and growth.Our business is subject to extensive government regula\ntion and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.Most\n jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine thatcertain\n aspects  of  our  business  are  subject  to  these  laws  and  could  require  us  to  obtain  licenses  to  continue  to  operate  in  such  jurisdictions.  For  example,  oursubsidiary\n in  the  Netherlands,  Uber  Payments  B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  by  its  competent  authority,  De  Nederlandsche  Bank,  as  an  electronic  moneyinstitution.\n This  authorization  permits  Uber  Payments  B.V.  to  provide  payment  services  (including  acquiring  and  executing  payment  transactions  and  moneyremittances,\n as  referred  to  in  the  Revised  Payment  Services  Directive  (2015/2366/EU))  and  to  issue  electronic  money  in  the  Netherlands.  In  addition,  UberPayments\n B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. Wecontinue to critically evaluate\n our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and supportthe\n future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our businessoperations\n before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease orlimit business\n37\n", "operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action,or stripped\n of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed asa\n payment  services  provider.  Were  local  regulators  to  determine  that  such  arrangements  require  us  to  be  so  licensed,  such  regulators  may  block  payments  toDrivers,\n merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantialdelay in payments we make in \ncertain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users wit\nh payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong\n Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach\n payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform\n user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform\n or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and\n prospects.  Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting\n all  necessary  authentication  steps.  Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived\n by  those  users.  A  substantial  increase  in  the  frequency  with  which  we  make  Driver  payments  without  having  received  corresponding  payments  fromconsumers could adversely a\nffect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.In\n addition,  laws  related  to  money  transmission  and  online  payments  are  evolving,  and  changes  in  such  laws  could  affect  our  ability  to  provide  paymentprocessing\n on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith\n changes  to  the  EU  Payment  Services  Directive,  caused  aspects  of  our  payment  operations  in  the  EEA  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  European  paymentsregulation.\n As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering,\n terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. EffectiveJuly\n 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulat\nions.In\n addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission,\n online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic fundstransfers,\n anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and exportrestrictions.\n Our  business  operations,  including  our  payments  to  Drivers  and  merchants,  may  not  always  comply  with  these  financial  laws  and  regulations.Historical\n or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,or\n other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits onour ability to expand our produc\nt offerings, could harm our business.Further,\n our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,and\n payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money launderingand\n sanctions  laws,  and  in  the  EEA  to  conduct  appropriate  risk  assessments  and  implement  appropriate  controls  as  a  regulated  financial  service  provider.Government\n authorities  may  seek  to  bring  legal  action  against  us  if  our  payment  system  is  used  for  improper  or  illegal  purposes  or  if  our  enterprise  riskmanagement or\n controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to ourbusiness.\nWe\n currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices and otherU.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes o\nf which could harm our business.We\n are  the  subject  of  DOJ  criminal  and  civil  inquiries  and  investigations,  as  well  as  civil  enforcement  inquiries  and  investigations  by  other  governmentagencies,\n including state AG offices in the United States and abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our businesspractices,\n such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved thebreach\n of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future,settle\n claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with theAttorneys\n General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related toour\n failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach andthe\n 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December2018,\n U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately  $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and maycontinue\n to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially materialfines\n and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued aproposed\n $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US SafetyReport. We negotiated the \ntotal payment to $9.1538\n", "million ($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021. Investigations and enforcement actionsfrom such entities, as wel\nl as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users\u2019 trust, could severely disrupt our business.We\n are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and othercountries.\nThese\n government  inquiries  and  investigations  are  time-consuming  and  require  a  great  deal  of  financial  resources  and  attention  from  us  and  our  seniormanagement.\n If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced tochange\n our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additionalreputational\n harm,  and  could  result  in  or  complicate  other  inquiries,  investigations,  or  lawsuits  from  other  regulators  in  future  merger  control  or  conductinvestigations. Any of these deve\nlopments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.We\n face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,legislative and regulatory act\nion, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.The\n nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.These\n and any future  privacy  or security  incidents  could result  in violation  of applicable  U.S. and international  privacy,  data protection,  and other laws. Suchviolations\n subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatoryentities\n in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been thesubject\n of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuantto\n which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how weprotect\n consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,future\n failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, U.K., Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately$1.6\n million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. In January 2016, we entered into a settlement with theOffice\n of the New York State Attorney General  under which we agreed  to enhance  our data security  practices.  In September  2018, we entered  into stipulatedjudgments\n with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 millionand\n assurances  that we would enhance  our data security  and privacy  practices.  Failure  to comply with these and other orders could result  in substantial  fines,enforcement\n actions,  injunctive  relief,  and  other  penalties  that  may  be  costly  or  that  may  impact  our  business.  We  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breachesexperienced\n by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatoryauthorities\n that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January14,\n 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breachthat\n Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potentialclaims to which we are exposed \nand may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.This\n risk  is  enhanced  in  certain  jurisdictions  with  stringent  privacy  laws  and,  as  we  expand  our  products,  offerings,  and  operations  domestically  andinternationally,\n we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacyand security. The EU adopted the GDP\nR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers\n and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use ofpersonal\n data,  strengthened  individual  data  rights,  data  breach  requirements,  limitations  on  data  retention,  strengthened  requirements  for  special  categories  ofpersonal\n data  and  pseudonymised  (i.e.,  key-coded)  data,  and  additional  obligations  for  contracting  with  service  providers  that  may  process  personal  data.  TheGDPR\n further  provides  that  EU  member  states  may  institute  additional  laws  and  regulations  impacting  the  processing  of  personal  data,  including  (i)  specialcategories\n of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automatedindividual\n decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming\n our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties,\n including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Otherjurisdictions outside\n the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California \nConsumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew\n operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of actionagainst\n businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.states\n have  adopted,  and  likely  will  continue  to  adopt,  similar  laws  that  provide  new  consumer  privacy  rights  and  business  operational  requirements.  Brazilprovides\n another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.These\n laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy RightsAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d)\n39\n", "passed in California in November 2020.Additionally,\n we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personaldata\n outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and \njudicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy\n of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If\n we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal\n data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be\n required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor\n obtaining  or  maintaining  a  license  or  otherwise,  from  law  enforcement  agencies,  and  from  intelligence  agencies.  This  disclosure  may  result  in  a  failure  orperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, n\notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us inthe\n same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain\n government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and\n ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto\n suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessing  significant  fines  or  penalties  against  us  or  shutting  down  our  or  Careem\u2019s  app  on  either  atemporary\n or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to co\nmply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the mannerin which we provide our products and off\nerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.Such\n data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thuscompliance\n requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,disclosure,\n and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceivedfailure\n by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us byindividuals,\n consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, iffound\n liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.If any of these events were \nto occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.Adverse\n litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit ourability to operate our business.\nWe\n have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legalproceedings\n by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We aresubject\n to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers\u2019 tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectualproperty\n infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any suchlitigation,\n investigations,  and  legal  proceedings  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  expensive.  Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  timeconsuming,\n costly,  and  harmful  to  our  reputation,  and  could  require  significant  amounts  of  management  time  and  corporate  resources.  If  any  of  these  legalproceedings\n were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced tochange the way in which we operate ou\nr business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In\n addition,  we  regularly  include  arbitration  provisions  in  our  terms  of  service  with  end-users.  These  provisions  are  intended  to  streamline  the  litigationprocess\n for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration maybecome more\n costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certainrisks\n to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may inthe\n future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increaseour\n litigation  costs  and  exposure  in  respect  of  such  proceedings.  For  example,  effective  May  15,  2018,  we  ended  mandatory  arbitration  of  sexual  misconductclaims by platform use\nrs and employees.Further,\n with  the  potential  for  conflicting  rules  regarding  the  scope  and  enforceability  of  arbitration  on  a  state-by-state  basis,  as  well  as  conflicting  rulesbetween\n state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories ofprotection.\n If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, wecould\n experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costlylawsuits, each of which could adve\nrsely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.40\n", "We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,investigations, and requests for information with respe\nct to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.We\n have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPAand\n other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political partiesfor the\n purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject toadditional\n compliance  requirements  to  identify  criminal  activity  and  payments  to  sanctioned  parties.  Our  activities  in  certain  countries  with  high  levels  ofcorruption\n enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, orbusiness\n partners  in  violation  of  various  anti-corruption  laws,  including  the  FCPA, even  though  the  actions  of  these  parties  are  often  outside  our  control.  Ouracquisition\n of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem\u2019s platform and Careem\u2019s employees, consultants, and business partners may not befamiliar\n with,  and  may  not  have  been  previously  subject  to,  these  anti-corruption  laws.  In  addition,  our  existing  and  future  safeguards,  including  training  andcompliance\n programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be heldresponsible.\n Additional  compliance  requirements  may  compel  us  to  revise  or  expand  our  compliance  program,  including  the  procedures  we  use  to  verify  theidentity of platform users\n and monitor international and domestic transactions.Drivers\n may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using ourplatform.\nMany\n Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial  taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions inwhich\n we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacificregion,\n and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to belicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportati\non company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Driversmay\n adversely  affect  our ability  to scale  our business  and operations.  In addition,  it  is possible that  various  jurisdictions  could  impose caps  on the number  oflicensed\n Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulationsthat were\n adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers becomesubject to such caps, limi\ntations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.We may be subject to liabil\nity for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.We\n operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attractDrivers\n may  be  challenged  by  competitors,  government  regulators,  or  individual  plaintiffs.  For  example,  putative  class  actions  have  been  filed  by  individualplaintiffs\n against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messagesfrom us regarding our Driver p\nrogram without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,we\n settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. Inconnection with\n this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming todefend,\n and,  if  resolved  adversely  to  us,  could  result  in  material  financial  damages  and  penalties,  costly  adjustments  to  our  business  practices,  and  negativepublicity.\n In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging thesepractices.\nOur\n business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurancecarriers\n change  the  terms  of  such  insurance  in  a  manner  not  favorable  to  Drivers  or  to  us,  if  we  are  required  to  purchase  additional  insurance  for  otheraspects of our business, or if we fail to compl\ny with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.We\n use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related toour\n Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motoristcoverage.\n We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on alimited\n number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannotguarantee\n that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain otherautomobile\n insurance  coverage  for  owned  vehicles  and  employee  activity,  as  well  as  insurance  coverage  for  non-automotive  corporate  risks  including  generalliability,\n workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a mannerunfavorable\n to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States andCanada\n than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significantadditional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive \ninsurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that41\n", "transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amountsthat\n may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustmentexpenses\n for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates,historical claim information, and industry data.\n While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of ourreserves.\n We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have asignificant impact on ou\nr unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.We\n may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers whouse\n our  platform,  even  when  those  Drivers  are  not  actively  using  our  platform  or  when  an  individual  impersonates  a  Driver.  As  we  expand  to  include  moreofferings\n on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and generalliability\n insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that areclaimed to\n have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims donot\n result  in  liability,  we  could  incur  significant  costs  in  investigating  and  defending  against  them.  If  insurers  become  insolvent,  they  may  not  be  able  to  payotherwise\n valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may besubject to negative publi\ncity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.In\n addition,  we  are  subject  to  local  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  relating  to  insurance  coverage  which  could  result  in  proceedings  or  actions  against  us  bygovernmental\n entities  or  others.  Legislation  has  been  passed  in  many  U.S.  jurisdictions  that  codifies  these  insurance  requirements  with  respect  to  ridesharing.Additional\n legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, serviceproviders\n and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts withus. Any failure, or perceived failure, by\n us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result inproceedings\n or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negativepublicity, require us to in\ncrease our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.We may be subject to pricing regulat\nions, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.Our revenue\n is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, havebeen,\n and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculateconsumer\n fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.Further,\n in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.Additional\n regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been thesubject\n of  litigation  and  regulatory  inquiries  related  to,  among  other  things,  the  calculation  of  and  statements  regarding  consumer  fares  and  Driver  earnings(including\n rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number ofmunicipalities\n have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As aresult, we may be forced to \nchange our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.If\n we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property ofothers, we may incur significant expense and our business may be advers\nely affected.Our\n intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardwaredesigns,\n registered  and  unregistered  trademarks,  trademark  applications,  copyrights,  trade  secrets,  inventions  (whether  or  not  patentable),  patents,  and  patentapplications. We\n believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If wedo\n not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers could devalueour products and offerings, and our \nability to compete effectively may be impaired.To\n protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,and disclosure restrictions.\n Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights asappropriate.\n We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,and distribution of, our proprietary information in\n a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property maynot\n be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we currently or in the futurewill\n operate. In addition, it may be possible for other parties to copy or reverse-engineer our products and offerings or obtain and use the content of our websitewithout authorization. Further, we\n may be unable to prevent competitors or other third parties from acquiring or using domain names or trademarks that are similarto,\n infringe  upon,  or  diminish  the  value  of  our  domain  names,  trademarks,  service  marks,  and  other  proprietary  rights.  Moreover,  our  trade  secrets  may  becompromised by third\n42\n", "parties or our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage derived from the compromised trade secrets. Further, we may be unable to detectinfringement\n of  our  intellectual  property  rights,  and  even  if  we  detect  such  violations  and  decide  to  enforce  our  intellectual  property  rights,  we  may  not  besuccessful,\n and may incur significant expenses, in such efforts. In addition, any such enforcement efforts may be time-consuming and may divert management\u2019sattention.\n Further, such enforcement efforts may result in a ruling that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable or invalid. Any failure to protect or anyloss\n of our intellectual property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operatingresults.\nCompanies\n in  the  Internet  and  technology  industries,  and  other  patent  and  trademark  holders,  including  \u201cnon-practicing  entities,\u201d  seeking  to  profit  fromroyalties\n in  connection  with  grants  of  licenses  or  seeking  to  obtain  injunctions,  own  large  numbers  of  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks,  and  trade  secrets  andfrequently\n enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have and may in the future continue toreceive notices tha\nt claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed upon other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights.Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas in whic\nh we historically have not operated, which could increaseour exposure to patent and othe\nr intellectual property claims. In addition, we, and companies we acquired or in which we have an interest, have been sued, and mayin\n the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual property infringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation. If a company we acquire or in which we havean\n interest loses rights to valuable intellectual property or is found to infringe third party intellectual property rights in such lawsuits, the value of our investmentmay materially decline.\nAny\n intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could divert our management\u2019sattention\n and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated with our brand. These claims may also subject us to significant liability for damages and mayresult\n in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. Further, certain adverseoutcomes of such proceedings cou\nld adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.We\n may  be  required  or  may  opt  to  seek  a  license  for  the  right  to  use  intellectual  property  held  by  others,  which  may  not  be  available  on  commerciallyreasonable\n terms,  or  at  all.  Even  if  a  license  is  available,  we  may  be  required  to  pay  significant  royalties  or  license  fees,  which  may  increase  our  operatingexpenses. We may\n also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effortand\n expense  and  make  us  less  competitive.  If  we  cannot  license  or  develop  alternative  technology,  content,  branding,  or  business  methods  for  any  allegedlyinfringing\n aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any ofthese results could harm ou\nr operating results.Our reported financial results may be adverse\nly affected by changes in accounting principles.The accounting\n for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our businessmodel,\n interpretations  of  relevant  accounting  principles,  enforcement  of  existing  or  new  regulations,  and  changes  in  SEC  or  other  agency  policies,  rules,regulations,\n and  interpretations,  of  accounting  regulations.  Changes  to  our  business  model  and  accounting  methods  could  result  in  changes  to  our  financialstatements,\n including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result inmaterially\n different  financial  results,  and  may  require  that  we  change  how  we  process,  analyze,  and  report  financial  information  and  our  financial  reportingcontrols.\nIf we are deemed an investment company under the Inv\nestment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business.The\n Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which \u201cinvestment companies\u201d are permitted to conducttheir business activities. We believe that\n we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d underthe\n Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constituteinvestments in non-controlled entities (including in China),\n referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned affiliates, we believe thatwe\n are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed aninvestment\n company,  such  a  determination  would  require  us  to  initiate  burdensome  compliance  requirements  and  comply  with  restrictions  imposed  by  theInvestment\n Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would havean adverse\n effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to therequirements\n of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assetsand pay significant taxes upon \nthe sale or transfer of such assets.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe\n market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance,and\n we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations.

Often, theirstock\n prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies\u2019 operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities classaction\n litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning in September 2019, several putative class actions were filed in California state andfederal courts against us, our directors,\n certain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws inconnection\n with  our  IPO.  Securities  litigation  could  subject  us  to  substantial  costs,  divert  resources  and  the  attention  of  management  from  our  business,  andseriously\n harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of any of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to decline significantly, andthere\n can be no assurance that our stock price would recover.

These provisions inc\nlude the following:\u2022\nour  board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, orremoval of a directo\nr, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\u2022\nadvance  notice  requirements  for  stockholder  proposals,  which  may  reduce  the  number  of  stockholder  proposals  available  for  stockholderconsideration;\n\u2022\nlimitations on stockholde r ability to convene special stockholder meetings, which could make it difficult for our44\n", "stockholders to adopt desired governance changes;\u2022\nprohibition on cumulative vo ting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and\u2022\nour  board of directors is able to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our board ofdirectors to issue pref\nerred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.Any\n provision  of  our  amended  and  restated  certificate  of  incorporation,  amended  and  restated  bylaws,  or  Delaware  law  that  has  the  effect  of  delaying  ordeterring\n a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect theprice\n that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. In addition, under our existing debt instruments, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, are subjectto\n certain limitations on our business and operations, including limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets. For information regarding theseand\n other provisions, see the risk factor titled \u201c-We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our paymentobligations\n under  such  indebtedness  may  limit  the  funds  available  to  us,  and  the  terms  of  our  debt  agreements  may  restrict  our  flexibility  in  operating  ourbusiness.\u201d\nSales, directly or indirectl\ny, of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.Sales,\n directly or indirectly, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the public perception that these sales might occur, could depress themarket price of our common\n stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We may issue our shares of commonstock or securities convertible or\n exchangeable into or exercisable for our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investmentsor otherwise. For\n example, on December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Postmates for aggregate consideration of approximately 70 million shares of ourcommon\n stock and equity awards covering approximately 13 million shares of our common stock. This and any other such issuance, including the issuance ofadditional\n shares of our common stock upon exercise of such equity awards, could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the tradingprice of our common stock to d\necline.We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the forese\neable future.We\n have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansionof\n our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, certain of our existing debt instruments includerestrictions\n on our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of ourcommon stock increases.\nOur\n amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federaldistrict\n courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit ourstockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a fa\nvorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.Our\n amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the followingtypes of actions or proceed\nings under Delaware statutory or common law:\u2022\nany derivative action o r proceeding brought on our behalf;\u2022\nany action asserting a br each of fiduciary duty;\u2022\nany  action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended andrestated certificate of incorporation\n, or our amended and restated bylaws;\u2022\nany action regarding our a mended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;\u2022\nany action as to which the Delawa re General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and\u2022\nany action asserting a c laim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.This\n provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courtshave exclusive jurisdic\ntion.Our\n amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum forresolving any\n complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware ofthe enforceability o\nf such exclusive forum provision. Although the Delaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusive forum provisions are facially valid, courtsin other jurisdictions m\nay find such provisions to be unenforceable.These\n exclusive-forum  provisions  may  limit  a  stockholder\u2019s  ability  to  bring  a  claim  in  a  judicial  forum  that  it  finds  favorable  for  disputes  with  us  or  ourdirectors, officers, o\nr other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers,45\n", "and  other  employees.  If  any  other  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  were  to  find  either  exclusive-forum  provision  in  our  amended  and  restated  certificate  ofincorporation\n to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriouslyharm our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAs a result of being a\n public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failureto maintain the adequacy of these internal contro\nls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.We\n are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, theeffectiveness of\n our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectivenessof\n our  internal  control  over  financial  annually.  We  currently  are  required  to  disclose  changes  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  have  materiallyaffected, or are reasonably li\nkely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.The\n process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly andchallenging,\n and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in sizeand\n complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline requiredfor a public company. During the \nevaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control overfinancial reporting, we \nwill be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.We\n cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growthofferings\n (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintaininternal\n control  over  financial  reporting  could  severely  inhibit  our  ability  to  accurately  report  our  financial  condition  or  operating  results.  If  we  are  unable  toconclude\n that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a materialweakness\n in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the marketprice\n of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SECor\n other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these andother effective control system\ns, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.ITEM 1B.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during theperiod\n 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. Theclaim\n alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain\n taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We denythese allegations and in\ntend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.Other Legal Proceedings\nWhile\n it  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  outcome  of  the  legal  actions,  investigations,  and  proceedings  brought  against  us,  we  believe  that,  except  for  thematters\n described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could bematerial\n to  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  in  any  one  accounting  period.  We  are  currently  involved  in,  and  may  in  the  future  be  involved  in,  legalproceedings,\n litigation,  claims,  and  government  investigations  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  In  addition,  the  nature  of  our  business  exposes  us  to  claimsrelated\n to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the UnitedStates\n where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and governmentinvestigations\n in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have amaterial\n adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, andgovernment\n investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorablepreliminary and inte\nrim rulings.ITEM 4.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  rapidlychanged\n market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of operations,financial\n position,  and  cash  flows.  Various  governmental  restrictions,  including  the  declaration  of  a  federal  National  Emergency,  multiple  cities\u2019  and  states\u2019declarations\n of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measureshave,\n and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides.Furthermore,\n we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to beimpacted by concerns reg\narding the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 Response Initiatives\nWe continue to priorit\nize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve and continue to believewe\n will play an important role in the economic recovery of cities around the globe. We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 throughpreserving\n our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The pandemic hasreduced the demand for our Mobility offering globally, while accelerating the gro\nwth of our Delivery offerings. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic bylaunching new, or expanding existing, s\nervices or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.To\n comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared rides Mobility offering inmost\n markets, and implemented \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options for Delivery offerings. Additionally, we have asked that all employees who are able to do so, towork remotely.\nAs\n vaccination  rates  increase  in  the  United  States,  we  are  observing  that  consumer  demand  for  Mobility  is  recovering  faster  than  driver  availability,  andconsumer\n demand for Delivery continues to exceed Courier availability. During the first half of 2021, we announced that we are increasing investments in driverincentives to improve dri\nver availability in the near-term.While\n we continue to assess the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately  predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business,results of operations, financial position, and cash\n flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, any futurewaves\n or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additionalactions\n that  may  be  taken  by  governmental  authorities,  the  further  impact  on  the  business  of  Drivers,  Merchants,  consumers,  and  business  partners,  and  otherfactors identified \nin Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Driver Classification Developments\nThe\n classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  We  areinvolved\n in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative\n agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers\n or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,2020,\n the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San FranciscoSuperior\n Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the allegedcompetitive advantage caused\n by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On\n August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. Foll\nowing a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe\n preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that useplatforms like ours for \nindependent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019spreliminary\n injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date ofProposition 22.\nIn\n January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,which\n was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled thatProposition\n 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and theProtect App-Based Drivers and Servic\nes has also filed an appeal.To comply with Proposition 22, we\n have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor\n for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, resultsof operations, financia\nl position, or cash flows.Also\n of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against usasserting that they should be \nclassified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent49\n", "contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our appwas\n switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majoritydecision on December 19, 2018. We app\nealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On\n February  19,  2021,  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  UK upheld  the  tribunal  ruling.  Subsequently,  we  initiated  a  historical  claims  settlement  process  for  UKdrivers. Damages may includ\ne back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate act\nion to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we annou\nnced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith\n Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proa\nctively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment impleme\nntation. The pension regulator hasconfirmed\n that  Uber  will  be  required  to  pay  historic  company  contributions,  but  that  we  are  not  required  to  pay  the  driver  component  of  historic  pensioncontributions\n unless  we  fail  to  comply  in  which  case  the  amount  equivalent  to  those  contributions  would  be  payable  as  a  penalty.  We  have  completed  theenrollment of eligib\nle drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our\n portal  for  drivers  to  register  for  a  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  haveextended offers to all d\nrivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.We\n are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers. Compensation hearings willtake place in 2022 for cl\naimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands \ncourt ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If,\n as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, wewould\n incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (includingminimum\n wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potentialpenalties.\n Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,and\n we  may  not  be  able  to  hire  a  majority  of  the  Drivers  currently  using  our  platform.  Any  of  these  events  could  negatively  impact  our  business,  result  ofoperations, financial pos\nition, and cash flows.For\n a discussion of risk factors related  to how misclassification  challenges  may impact our business, result of operations, financial  position and operatingcondition\n and  cash  flows,  see  the  risk  factor  titled  \u201c-Our  business  would  be  adversely  affected  if  Drivers  were  classified  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees\u201d\n included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, and Note 15 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in PartII, Item 8, \u201cFinancial St\natements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In\n addition,  if  we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  this  may  impact  our  current  financial  statement  presentation  including  revenue,  cost  ofrevenue,\n incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to theconsolidated\n financial  statements  included  in  Part  II,  Item  8,  \u201cFinancial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,\u201d  and  the  section  titled  \u201cCritical  AccountingEstimates\u201d in Part II, \nItem 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.50\n", "Financial and Operational HighlightsYear Ended December 31,\nConstant Currency (In millions, except percentages)\n2020 2021 2020 to 2021 %Change\n2020 to 2021 % Change Monthly Active Platform Consumers \n(\u201cMAPCs\u201d) 93 118 27 %Trips \n5,025 6,368 27 %Gross Bookings \n$ 57,897 $ 90,415 56 %53 % Revenue\n$ 11,139 $ 17,455 57 %54 % Net loss attributable to Ube\nr Technologies, Inc. $ (6,768) $ (496) 93 %Mobility Adjusted EBITDA\n$ 1,169 $ 1,596 37 %Delivery Adjusted EBITDA\n$ (873) $ (348) 60 %Adjusted EBITDA \n$ (2,528) $ (774) 69 % See\n the section titled \u201cReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAPfinancial measure.\n See the section titled \n\u201cCertain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for more information.MAPCs presented for annual periods ar\ne MAPCs for the fourth quarter of the year.Net loss attributable to Ube\nr Technologies, Inc. includes stock-based compensation expense of $827 million and $1.2 billion during the years endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, respectiv\nely.Highlights for 2021\nOverall\n Gross Bookings increased by $32.5 billion in 2021, up 56%, or 53% on a constant currency basis, compared to 2020.

We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costsrelated\n to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $362 million in total restructuringand\n related charges in the consolidated statement of operations. Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily forseverance and other terminatio\nn benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.These\n activities  were  designed  to  generate  an  aggregate  cost  savings  of  at  least  $1.0  billion  annually  when  compared  to  our  original  fourth  quarter  2020planned cost structure, with the\n largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce. We do not believe these cost-saving measures will impair ourability\n to conduct any of our key business functions. As of December 31, 2021, we achieved these aggregate cost savings when compared to our original fourthquarter\n 2020 planned cost structure.

Mobility Take Rate was 19.0%, down from 22.9% compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in Mobility Driverincentives, as Mobility Driv\ner additions have been outpaced by higher demand recovery in the U.S. and other markets.Mobility\n adjusted  EBITDA  profit  increased  primarily  attributable  to  an  increase  in  Mobility  revenue,  partially  offset  by  variable  costs  attributable  to  theoverall growth of the business.\nDelivery Segment\nFor\n the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Delivery revenue increased $4.5 billion, or 114% and Delivery adjustedEBITDA loss improved $525 million, or 60%.\nDelivery\n revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 66%, on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase infood\n delivery  orders  and  higher  basket  sizes  as  a  result  of  stay-at-home  demand  related  to  COVID-19,  combined  with  continued  expansion  across  U.S.  andinternational\n markets. Take Rate improved to 16.2% from 12.9% compared to the same period in 2020 driven by a decrease in incentive spend combined with anoverall\n improvement in basket sizes. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue and Take Rate resulting from an increase in certain Courier paymentsand incentives that ar\ne recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.Delivery\n adjusted  EBITDA  loss  improved,  primarily  attributable  to  an  increase  in  Delivery  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  $2.6  billion  increase  in  cost  ofrevenue as well as a $710 mil\nlion increase in consumer promotions, brand marketing, and employee headcount costs.Freight Segment\nFor\n the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Freight revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 111% and Freight adjustedEBITDA loss improved $97 million, or 43%.\nFreight\n revenue increased primarily attributable  to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the increase in Freight revenue isalso driven by the \ngrowth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in volumes with our top shippers.Freight\n adjusted EBITDA loss improved, primarily attributable to a $135 million improvement in gross profit as a result of increased load margins, partiallyoffset by an increase in \nemployee headcount costs.(1)(2), (3)\n(4)\n(1\n)(2\n)(3) \n(4)\n59\n", "All OtherFor\n the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  All  Other  revenue  decreased  $127  million,  or  94%  and  All  Otheradjusted EBITDA loss improved $450 million, or 98%.\nAll\n Other revenue and All Other adjusted EBITDA loss improved primarily due to the  favorable impact of the sale of our ATG Business in the first quarter of2021 and the JUMP Divestiture in the second qu\narter of 2020.Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted \nEBITDA  and revenue  growth rates in constant currency  are non-GAAP financial  measures.

MAPCs  is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Deliveryorder\n on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on ourplatform\n in  a  given  month,  that  unique  consumer  is  counted  as  only  one  MAPC.  We  use  MAPCs  to  assess  the  adoption  of  our  platform  and  frequency  oftransactions, which are key \nfactors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\nTrips. \nWe  define  Trips  as  the  number  of  completed  consumer  Mobility  or  New  Mobility  rides  and  Delivery  orders  in  a  given  period.  For  example,  anUberPOOL\n ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe thatTrips are a useful met\nric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\n60\n", "Gross Bookings. We  define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility and New Mobility rides;Delivery\n orders (in each case without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds); Driver and Merchant earnings; Driver incentives; and Freight revenue.Gross Bookings do not include tips earned by Driv\ners.

In addition to revenue, net income(loss),\n income  (loss)  from  operations,  and  other  results  under  GAAP,  we  use  Adjusted  EBITDA  and  revenue  growth  rates  in  constant  currency,  which  aredescribed\n below, to evaluate  our business. We have included  these non-GAAP financial  measures  because  they are key measures  used by our management  toevaluate\n our  operating  performance.  Accordingly,  we  believe  that  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  useful  information  to  investors  and  others  inunderstanding\n and  evaluating  our  operating  results  in  the  same  manner  as  our  management  team  and  board  of  directors.  Our  calculation  of  these  non-GAAP\n financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measuresshould not be considered in isola\ntion from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.Adjusted EBITDA\nWe\n define  Adjusted  EBITDA  as  net  income  (loss),  excluding  (i)  income  (loss)  from  discontinued  operations,  net  of  income  taxes,  (ii)  net  income  (loss)attributable\n to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interestexpense,\n (vi)  other  income  (expense),  net,  (vii)  depreciation  and  amortization,  (viii)  stock-based  compensation  expense,  (ix)  certain  legal,  tax,  and  regulatoryreserve changes and sett\nlements, (x) goodwill and asset61\n", "impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items notindicative of our ongoing oper\nating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impactedby\n COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment,the costs related to f\nree rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations.We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Repo\nrt on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operatingperformance,\n generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that AdjustedEBITDA\n provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management teamand\n board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cashexpenses and certain variable charges. To\n help our board, management and investors assess the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, we are excludingthe\n impacts  of  COVID-19  response  initiatives  related  payments  for  financial  assistance  to  Drivers  personally  impacted  by  COVID-19,  the  cost  of  personalprotective\n equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides andfood\n deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations from Adjusted EBITDA. Our board and management find theexclusion\n of the impact of these COVID-19 response initiatives from Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it allows us and our investors to assess the impact ofthese response initiat\nives on our results of operations.COVID-19 Response Initiatives\nTo\n support  those  whose  earning  opportunities  have  been  depressed  as  a  result  of  COVID-19,  as  well  as  communities  hit  hard  by  the  pandemic,  we  haveannounced and implemented several initiatives, including, in particular, payment\ns for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost ofpersonal\n protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to freerides\n and  food  deliveries  to  healthcare  workers,  seniors,  and  others  in  need  as  well  as  charitable  donations.  The  payments  for  financial  assistance  to  Driverspersonally\n impacted by COVID-19 and Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment are recorded as a reduction to revenue.The cost of personal protec\ntive equipment distributed to Drivers, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in needas well as charitable don\nations are recorded as an expense in our costs and expenses.Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjust\ned EBITDA ReconciliationAdjusted\n EBITDA has limitations  as a financial  measure,  should be considered  as supplemental  in nature,  and is not meant  as a substitute  for the relatedfinancial informa\ntion prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets,and\n although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA doesnot reflect all cash capital expe\nnditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash;\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurringexpense in our business and an impor\ntant part of our compensation strategy;\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related paymentsfor\n financial  assistance  to  Drivers  personally  impacted  by  COVID-19,  the  cost  of  personal  protective  equipment  distributed  to  Drivers,  Driverreimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, senior\ns,and others in need as well as ch\naritable donations;\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign currency exchangegains\n (losses),  net;  gain  (loss) on business  divestitures,  net; and unrealized  gain (loss)  on debt and equity  securities,  net; and impairment  of debt  andequity securities; and\n\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.62\n", " The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, toAdjusted EBITDA for each of the periods ind\nicated:Year Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2020 2021 Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation:\nNet loss attributable to Ube\nr Technologies, Inc.$ (6,768) $ (496) Add (deduct):\nNet loss attributable to non\n-controlling interests, net of tax(20) (74) Provision for (benefit fro\nm) income taxes(192) (492) Loss from equity method invest\nments34 37 Interest expense\n458 483 Other (income) expense, net\n1,625 (3,292) Depreciation and amortization\n575 902 Stock-based compensation expense\n827 1,168 Legal, tax, and regulatory \nreserve changes and settlements(35) 526 Goodwill and asset impairmen\nts/loss on sale of assets317 157 Acquisition, financing and dives\ntitures related expenses86 102 Accelerated lease \ncosts related to cease-use of ROU assets102 5 COVID-19 response initiatives\n106 54 Gain on lease arrangemen\nt, net(5) \u2014 Restructuring and relat\ned charges, net362 \u2014 Legacy auto insurance tr\nansfer \u2014 103 Mass arbitration fees\n\u2014 43 Adjusted EBITDA\n$ (2,528) $ (774)  For further information, refer to Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financialstatements included in Pa\nrt II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Constant Currency\nWe\n compare the percent change in our current period results from the corresponding prior period using constant currency disclosure.

The decrease in cash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily drivenby\n an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, an increase in our insurance reserves, partially offset by higher accounts receivable and prepaid expensesand\n lower operating lease liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities also reflects a $1.0 billion cash inflow related to a legacy auto insurance transfer. Foradditional\n information on the legacy auto insurance transfer, see Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included inPart II, Item 8, \u201cFinanci\nal Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.(1)(1\n)63\n", "Net cash used in operating activities was $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 , primarily consisting of $6.8 billion of net loss, adjusted forcertain\n non-cash  items,  which  primarily  included  $1.7  billion  in  impairment  of  non-marketable  equity  securities,  $827  million  of  stock-based  compensationexpense,\n depreciation and amortization expense of $575 million, $404 million in impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and other assets, as well as a $393million\n decrease in cash consumed by working capital. The decrease in cash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily driven by adecrease in our operating lease right-of-use assets, prepaid expense\ns and other assets and increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by loweraccounts payable and \noperating lease liabilities.Investing Activities\nNet\n cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $2.3 billion in acquisition of businesses,net of cash acquired,\n $1.1 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $982 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities, $297 million in purchases ofnotes\n receivable, and $298 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $2.3billion, proceeds from th\ne sale of equity method investments of $1.0 billion and proceeds from sale of non-marketable equity securities of $500 million.Net\n cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisting of $2.1 billion in purchases of marketablesecurities, $1.5 billion in acquisition of busine\nsses, net of cash acquired and $616 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds frommaturities and sales o\nf marketable securities of $1.4 billion.Financing Activities\nNet\n cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was  $1.8  billion  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  primarily  consisting  of  $1.5  billion  of  proceeds  fromissuance\n of notes, net of issuance cost, $675 million of proceeds from the issuance and sale of subsidiary preferred stock units, partially offset by $307 million ofprincipal\n repayment on the non-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes related to the acquisition of Careem (\u201cCareem Notes\u201d) and $226 million principalpayments on finance leas\nes.Net\n cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was  $1.4  billion  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  primarily  consisting  of  $2.6  billion  of  proceeds  fromissuance of\n notes, net of issuance costs and $247 million of proceeds from issuance of subsidiary preferred stock units, partially offset by $891 million of principalrepayment on Careem Notes and $527 \nmillion of principal repayment on term loan and notes.Other Information\nAs\n of December 31, 2021, $2.2 billion of our $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the UnitedStates\n may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result inimmaterial\n tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We arein compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of December 31, 202\n1, including by meeting our reporting obligations.

As of December 31, 2021, we had $394million in non-cancel\nable commitments, with varying expiration terms through December 15, 2026.Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe\n believe  that the following accounting  policies  involve a high degree  of judgment  and complexity  and are critical  to understanding  and evaluating  ourconsolidated\n financial condition and results of our operations. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accountingestimate\n to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could havebeen\n used,  or  changes  in  the  accounting  estimates  that  are  reasonably  likely  to  occur  periodically,  could  materially  impact  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,liabilities, revenu\ne and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience andon\n various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  thecarrying\n values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to theinherent uncertainty invol\nved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.64\n", "We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of ourconsolidated\n financial  statements.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants withend-users\n to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and wehave no performance oblig\nation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment\n is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-userand\n are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). Wehave\n concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Deliverytransactions.\n The  assessment  of  whether  we  are  considered  the  principal  or  the  agent  in  a  transaction  could  impact  the  accounting  for  certain  payments  andincentives provided to Drive\nrs and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In\n certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsettingagainst\n any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,uncollected service fees for ca\nsh trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver Incentives\nWe\n offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided tocustomers\n are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the servicereceived. Incentives offered i\nn exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriateclassification\n of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotionswhich are recorded as a r\neduction of revenue.Business Combinations\nWe\n allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimatedfair\n values. The excess of the fair  value of purchase  consideration  over the fair values of these identifiable  assets and liabilities  is recorded as goodwill. Suchvaluations\n require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certainintangible\n assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,and\n trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, usefullives, and discount rates.\nManagement's\n estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as aresult,\n actual  results  may  differ  from  estimates.  Allocation  of  purchase  consideration  to  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  affects  our  amortization  expense,  asacquired\n finite-lived  intangible  assets  are  amortized  over  the  useful  life,  whereas  any  indefinite  lived  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  are  not  amortized.During\n the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,with the corresponding offset \nto goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Embedded Derivatives\nDuring\n 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are composed ofconversion\n options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the totalnumber\n of  shares  of  our  common  stock  delivered  to  settle  these  embedded  features  will  have  a  fixed  value.  These  conversion  options  are  bifurcated  from  theunderlying\n instrument  and  accounted  for  and  valued  separately  from  the  host  instrument.  Embedded  derivatives  are  recognized  as  derivative  liabilities  on  ourconsolidated\n balance  sheet.  We  measure  these  instruments  at  their  estimated  fair  value  and  recognize  changes  in  their  estimated  fair  value  in  other  income(expense), net in our consolid\nated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.We\n value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial PublicOffering (\u201cQIPO\u201d) conversion option \n(\u201cQIPO Conversion Option\u201d). The fair value of these convertible65\n", "notes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPOdates\n to the valuation date. The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield,which\n was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes. The discount rate is updated during eachperiod to reflect th\ne yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.Upon\n closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock. For additionalinformation,\n refer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form10-K.\nInvestments\u2014Non-Marketable Equity and Debt Securities\nWe\n hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which wedo not\n have a controlling interest or significant influence. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost andare\n subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.Investments\n in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date withthe\n changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account forinvestments in debt and equi\nty securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Investments\n in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requiresjudgment\n due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimatedfair\n value  of  our  investments  in  privately  held  companies,  we  utilize  the  most  recent  data  available  including  observed  transactions  such  as  equity  financingtransactions of the\n investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similarto the equity and debt secur\nities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We\n assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equitysecurities\n includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If anequity\n investment  is  considered  to  be  impaired  we  will  establish  a  new  carrying  value  for  the  investment  and  recognize  an  impairment  loss  through  ourconsolidated\n statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below itsamortized\n cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, thedifference\n between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-downof\n the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factorsconsidered\n in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit qualityof\n the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we comparethe\n present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related\n impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balancesheet\n with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensiveincome\n (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and correspondingreduction in the allowanc\ne for credit loss.Equity Method Investments\nWe\n account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence,but not\n a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, werecognize\n through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities\u2019 netincome or\n loss, and the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities\u2019 net income or loss one quarter inarrears.\n Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected inearnings.\nWe\n review  our  equity  method  investments  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  business  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of  theinvestment\n may  not  be  fully  recoverable.  Qualitative  and  quantitative  factors  considered  as  indicators  of  a  potential  impairment  include  financial  results  andoperating trends of the inv\nestees, implied values in transactions of the investee\u2019s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding theinvestment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment woul\nd have to be determinedand an\n impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly forinvestments in privately \nheld companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and66\n", "assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairmentcharges.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nWe\n review  goodwill  for  impairment  annually  (in  the  fourth  quarter)  and  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  goodwill  might  beimpaired.\n We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carryingvalues\n for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers reviewfinancial results, evaluate perf\normance, and allocate resources.Judgment\n in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political,business,\n and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affectingthe reporting\n unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative testis then performed.\nPerforming\n a  quantitative  goodwill  impairment  test  includes  the  determination  of  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  and  involves  significant  estimates  andassumptions.\n These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows,risk-adjusted discount\n rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.Loss Contingencies\nWe\n are  involved  in  legal  proceedings,  claims,  and  regulatory,  indirect  tax  examinations,  or  government  inquiries  and  investigations  that  may  arise  in  theordinary\n course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability whenwe\n believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible andthe loss or range of loss can be \nreasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.We\n review the  developments  in our contingencies  that  could affect  the  amount of the  provisions that  have  been  previously  recorded,  and the matters  andrelated\n reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed.  We  make  adjustments  to  our  provisions  and  changes  to  our  disclosures  accordingly  to  reflect  the  impact  ofnegotiations,\n settlements,  rulings, advice  of legal  counsel, and updated information.  Significant  judgment  is required  to determine  both the probability  and theestimated\n amount of loss. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to changebased on new information and futu\nre events.The\n outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolvedagainst\n us for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reportingperiod in which any such outcome be\ncomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.Income Taxes\nWe\n are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  We  account  for  income  taxes  using  the  asset  and  liability  method.  Theestablishment\n of  deferred  tax  assets  from  intra-entity  transfers  of  intangible  assets  requires  management  to  make  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  todetermine the\n fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenueand expense forecasts, the\n estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expectedfuture cash flows to present value are\n derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.Although\n we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal andexternal\n comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of suchassumptions, estimates or \nactual results.We\n account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will besustained\n upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require makingjudgments,\n assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final taxoutcome\n of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To theextent\n that  the  final  tax  outcome  of these  matters  is  different  than  the  amounts  recorded,  such  differences  may  impact  the  provision  for  income  taxes  and  theeffective tax ra\nte in the period in which such determination is made.The\n provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition,we are\n subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularlyassess the likelihood of adve\nrse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.67\n", "Insurance ReservesWe\n use a combination  of third-party  insurance  and self-insurance  mechanisms,  including  a wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary,  to provide  for  thepotential\n liabilities  for  certain  risks,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and  underinsured  motorist,  auto  physical  damage,  general  liability,  and  workers\u2019compensation.\n The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of theultimate\n unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but notreported\n as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim andloss\n experience.  In  addition,  we  use  assumptions  based  on  actuarial  judgment  related  to  claim  and  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  whichconsider\n frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.  These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  newinformation becomes known. Adjustm\nents, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates\n of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of theinsurance\n claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual resultsdepend\n upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,and\n social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the nearterm from the estimated amounts.\nWhile management be\nlieves that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.Stock-Based Compensation\nWe\n have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members ofour\n board of directors and non-employees. The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstandingRSUs,\n as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards containsservice-based vesting\n condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for themajority\n of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financialand operation metrics. Th\ne market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.We\n account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accountingstandards,\n which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We accountfor forfeitures when they o\nccur.We\n have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inp\nuts and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interestrates, expected stock pr\nice volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black\n-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\u2022\nExpected term. We estimate the exp ected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.\u2022\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free inter est rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\u2022\nExpected volatility.  We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility ofour\n own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term. Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter thanthe expected term, we cons\nider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.\u2022\nExpected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is z ero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.We\n continue  to  use  judgment  in  evaluating  the  expected  volatility  and  expected  term  utilized  in  our  stock-based  compensation  expense  calculation  on  aprospective\n basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expectedterm, which could mater\nially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee\n Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\u201cFinancial Statements \nand Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.68\n", "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe\n are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur\n exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025\n and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour\n consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis pointincrease or decrease in interest\n rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of\n our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin\n periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 millionas of December 31, 2021.\nInvestment Risk\nOur\n investment  policy  objective  aims  to  preserve  capital  and  meet  liquidity  requirements  without  significantly  increasing  risk.  We  had  cash  and  cashequivalents including\n restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Wedid\n not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money marketfunds\n and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest raterisk.\n Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change ininterest rates would n\not have a material effect on our financial results.We\n are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently\n public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult tovalue\n given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.These investments\n in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes inthe\n fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a setperiod of time afte\nr a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency Risk\nWe\n transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us tothe\n risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operatingexpenses\n denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Accordingly,  changes  in  exchange  rates  may  negatively  affect  our  future  revenue  and  otheroperating\n results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar isdiversified across geogr\naphic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We\n have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurementof our\n asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currencyrates\n may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter intoderivatives or other f\ninancial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.69\n", "ITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December31,\n 2021, based on criteria established in Internal  Control - Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission (COSO).\nIn our\n opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December31,\n 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity withaccounting\n principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internalcontrol over financia\nl reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Changes in Accounting Principles\nAs discussed in\n Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible instruments and contracts inan entity\u2019s own equity in 2021 and the \nmanner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.Basis for Opinions\nThe\n Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and forits\n assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  Management\u2019s  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial  Reportingappearing under Item\n 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control overfinancial\n reporting  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)(PCAOB)\n and  are  required  to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  andregulations of the Securi\nties and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We\n conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonableassurance\n about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  whether  effective  internalcontrol over financial reporti\nng was maintained in all material respects.Our\n audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financialstatements,\n whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidenceregarding\n the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significantestimates\n made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financialreporting\n included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  andevaluating\n the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as weconsidered necessary in th\ne circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As\n described in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d) and TupeloParent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 3\n1, 2021 because they were acquired by the Company inpurchase\n business combinations during 2021. We have also excluded Drizly and Transplace from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Drizly andTransplace\n are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management\u2019s assessment and our audit of internal control overfinancial\n reporting collectively represent approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the yearended December 31, 2021.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Repor\ntingA\n company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation\n of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately an\nd fairly reflect the transactionsand\n dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financialstatements in accordance with\n generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of management\n and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding71\n", "prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because\n of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness\n to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur\nes may deteriorate.Critical Audit Matters\nThe\n critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor\n required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and(ii)\n involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe\n consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on thecritical audit matters or on the\n accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and De\nlivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs\n described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of theCompany\u2019s\n platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged toend-users\n for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal oragent\n in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.  This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  thepresentation\n of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the yearended\n December  31,  2021,  the  Company\u2019s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3  billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,refunds, and credits provided \nto end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The\n principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, includingincentives,\n discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing thepresentation\n of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,which\n in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whethertransaction attributes were a\nppropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing\n the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These  procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to  the  Company\u2019s  revenue  recognition  process,  including  controls  over  thepresentation of Mobility \nand Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, triptransaction attributes\n and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driverstatements,\n rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue andincome statement classification.\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs\n described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of\n the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor\n losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied\n to historical  claim  and loss experience.  In addition,  management  uses assumptions  based  on actuarial  judgment  related  to claim  and loss developmentpatterns\n and  expected  loss  costs,  which  consider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.  These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  bymanagement\n and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  new  information  becomes  known.  The  Company\u2019s  short-term  and  long-term  insurance  reserves  as  ofDecember 31, 2021 totaled $4.0 bil\nlion.The\n principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  the  valuation  of  insurance  reserves  is  a  critical  audit  matter  are  thesignificant\n judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivityand\n effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  the  actuarial  methods  and  management\u2019s  significant  assumptions  related  to  lossdevelopment patterns and \nexpected loss costs. The audit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing\n the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company\u2019s valuation of insurance reserves, including controls over thedevelopment\n of  the  significant  assumptions  related  to  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss  costs.  These  procedures  also  included,  among  others,  theinvolvement of professiona\nls with specialized skill72\n", "and knowledge to assist in (i) developing, for selected reserve components, an independent actuarial estimate of the insurance reserves, and comparison of thisindependent\n estimate  to  management\u2019s  actuarially  determined  reserves,  and  (ii)  testing,  for  other  selected  reserve  components,  management\u2019s  process  forestimating\n the insurance reserves. Developing the independent estimate involved independently developing the loss development patterns and expected loss costsand\n testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  data  provided  by  management.  Testing  management\u2019s  process  for  estimating  the  insurance  reserves  involvedevaluating\n the appropriateness of management\u2019s actuarial methods, evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related toloss development patterns \nand expected loss costs used in those methods, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management./s/

\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUber\n Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber isa\n technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber\n develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connectsconsumers\n (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and  other  consumers(\u201cEaters\u201d)\n with restaurants,  grocers  and other stores (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d)  with delivery  service  providers  (\u201cCouriers\u201d)  for meal  preparation,  grocery  andother\n delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas\n \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shipp\ners with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our\n technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe\n accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(\u201cGAAP\u201d).\n We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d)where\n we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.  Refer  to  Note  16  \u2013  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.  All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been e\nliminated.Use of Estimates\nThe preparation\n of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, an\nd other assumptions whichmanagement\n believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments\n and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired\n intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain\n deferred tax assets and tax liabilities;  insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could\n differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain\n of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments\n and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial\n markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial perfor\nmance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit Risk\nCash\n and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit\n risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency\n securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial\n issuer. Cash deposits  typically  exceed  insured  limits  and are  placed  with financial  institutions  around the  world that  we believe  are  of high creditquality.\n We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld\n by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on alimited\n number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment serviceproviders\n are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for theyears ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\nWe\n have  incurred  significant  net  losses  since  inception  and  had  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $23.6  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021.  Our  operations  havehistorically\n been funded through equity and debt financings. While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolvingcredit\n facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements,additional capital may\n need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives. We may not be able toobtain additional\n82\n", "financing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt instruments.In\n March  2020,  the  World  Health  Organization  declared  the  outbreak  of  COVID-19  a  pandemic.  COVID-19  has  rapidly  impacted  market  and  economicconditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented\n, including business activities and travelrestrictions,\n and  \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d  orders,  that  have  had  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business  and  operations  by  reducing,  in  particular,  the  global  demand  forMobility\n offerings,  while  accelerating  the  growth  of  our  Delivery  offerings.  In  light  of  the  evolving  nature  of  COVID-19  and  the  uncertainty  it  continues  toproduce\n around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results ofoperations,\n financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely onfuture\n developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be furtherresurgences of the\n outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financialmarkets;\n governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all ofwhich are highly uncertain \nand cannot be predicted.Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash\n and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  held  in  checking  and  savings  accounts  as  well  as  investments  in  money  market  funds,  commercial  paper,  U.S.government\n and  agency  securities,  and  corporate  bonds.  We  consider  all  highly-liquid  investments  purchased  with  an  original  or  remaining  maturity  of  threemonths\n or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants, whichare included in accru\ned and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted cash\n and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for certain insurance policies andalso\n include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or contractual restrictions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents areclassified\n as current and non-current assets based on the contractual or estimated term of the remaining restriction. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalentsand restricted cash and \ncash equivalents to amounts presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows (in millions):As of December 31,\n2019\n2020 2021 Cash and cash equivalents\n$ 10,873 $ 5,647 $ 4,295 Restricted cash and cash equ\nivalents - current99 250 631 Restricted cash and cash equ\nivalents - non-current1,095 1,494 2,879 Total cash and cash equival\nents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents$ 12,067 $ 7,391 $ 7,805 Collateral Held by Insurer\nCollateral\n held  by  insurer  represents  funds  held  by  James  River  Group  companies  (\u201cJames  River\u201d).  These  funds,  previously  held  in  a  trust  account,  werewithdrawn by James River during the fourth\n quarter of 2019 upon notice of cancellation of their insurance policies (primarily auto insurance policies) issued to oneof\n our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, the funds served as collateral for us and our subsidiary\u2019s current and future claim settlement obligations under theindemnification agreements\n for these insurance policies as included in insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheet . Accordingly, the amount withdrawn is presented as collate\nral held by insurer on the consolidated balance sheet  as of December 31, 2020. During the third quarter of 2021\n, in connection with the lega cy auto insurance transfer as described below, James River returned funds, previously presented ascollateral\n held by insurer, to the trust account where the funds were previously held. Accordingly, the funds were reclassified from collateral  held by insurer tonon-current restric\nted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance she et as of December 31, 2021.Legacy Auto Insurance Transfer\nOn September\n 27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance Agreement(the\n \u201cLPTA\u201d) with James  River effective  July 1, 2021. Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary reinsured certain automobile liability insurancerisks\n relating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in theamount of $345 million (\u201cPremium\u201d). Subsequent to\n the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risktransfer\n arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River will be transferred to a third-party claims administrator forongoing\n handling (the \u201cTransferred Claims\u201d) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the Transferred Claims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021,and\n adverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities. During the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a $103 million charge in our consolidatedstatement of operat\nions consisting of the difference between83\n", "the Premium and the assumed liabilities (including the cost of future claims administration), expenses associated with the LPTA, and the adverse development onthe Transferred Claims.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts\n receivable represents uncollected payments from end-users for completed transactions where (i) the payment method is credit card and includes (a)end-user payments not yet settled with payment\n service providers, and (b) end-user payments settled by payment service providers but not yet remitted to us, or (ii)completed\n shipments where we invoice Freight customers (\u201cShippers\u201d) and payment has not been received. The timing of settlement of amounts due from theseparties\n varies by region and by product. The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabilities.Refer to Note 10 \u2013 Supplemental Finan\ncial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and Merchants.Although\n we  pre-authorize  forms  of  payment  to  mitigate  our  exposure,  we  bear  the  cost  of  any  accounts  receivable  losses.  We  record  an  allowance  fordoubtful\n accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions.We consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for\n fare amounts to be direct and incremental costs to revenue earned and, therefore, the costs are included as costof\n revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the allowance based on historical experience, estimated future payments and geographicaltrends,\n which are reviewed periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible. Chargebacks and credit card losses were$195 million, $178 million and $246 m\nillion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.Property and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight\n\u2011 linemethod over the estima\nted useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:Property and Equipment\nEstimated Useful Life Land\nIndefinite Buildings\n30-45 years Site improvements\n5-15 years Leased vehicles\n3-10 years Computer equipment\n3-5 years Furniture and fixtures\n3-5 years Dockless e-bikes\n3 years Internal-use software\n2 years Leased computer equipment\nShorter of estimated usef ul life or lease termLeasehold improvements\nShorter of estimated usef ul life or lease termWhen assets are retired\n or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain orloss is reflected\n in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized. Maintenance and repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life arecharged to operating expens\nes as incurred.We capitalize c\nertain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstanding debt, in developing internal-use\n software once planning has been completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completedand\n the software will function as intended. Amortization of such costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and beginsonce the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together \nwith costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed asincurred. In addition, we cap\nitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.Leased vehicle\n assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The vast majority of our leased vehicle assets were reclassified to assets held for saleas of\n December 31, 2018. In January 2019, an agreement was executed with Waydrive Holdings Pte. Ltd. (\u201cWaydrive\u201d) to purchase the Lion City Rentals Pte. Ltd.(\u201cLCR\u201d),\n a wholly-owned vehicle solutions subsidiary of ours based in Singapore. Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures for further information. When leased vehiclesare\n retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements ofoperations in the period r\nealized. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to operating expenses as incurred.84\n", "LeasesWe\n adopted Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 842, \u201cLeases\u201d (\u201cASC 842\u201d) on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition methodand\n used the effective date as the date of initial application. We elected the \u201cpackage of practical expedients,\u201d which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 ourprior conclusions\n about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from leasecomponents, therefore, we a\nccount for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption forall leases that qualify.\nWe\n determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economicbenefits\n from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to anasset\n which  we  do  not  own.  Right  of  use  (\u201cROU\u201d)  assets  represent  our  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  and  lease  liabilities  represent  ourobligation\n to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilitiesare\n recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the futurelease\n payments  is  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  (\u201cIBR\u201d),  because  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  most  of  our  leases  is  not  readily  determinable.  The  IBR  is  ahypothetical\n rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to thelease\n payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixedpayments\n or  in-substance  fixed  payments  are  included  in  our  lease  liability  calculation.  Variable  lease  payments  may  include  costs  such  as  common  areamaintenance,\n utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for thosepayments are incurred.\nOperating\n leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidatedbalance\n sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidatedbalance\n sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense isrecognized\n as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. As of December31, 2020 and 2021, less than 12% of our operat\ning lease ROU assets related to leased assets were outside of the U.S.Acquisitions\nWe\n account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d (\u201cASC 805\u201d). Thepurchase\n price  of  the  acquisition  is  allocated  to  the  tangible  and  intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  based  on  their  estimated  fair  values  at  theacquisition\n date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one yearfrom the\n acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusionof\n the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments arerecorded in the consolida\nted statements of operations. Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations for further information.Goodwill\nGoodwill\n represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting unitsexpected\n to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes incircumstances\n indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigngoodwill using a relative fair\n value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence ofevents\n or circumstances  leads to a determination  that it  is more likely  than not that the  fair  value  of a reporting  unit is less than  its carrying  amount. If,  afterassessing\n the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,then additional impai\nrment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The\n quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value,goodwill is considered not to be i\nmpaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairmentloss\n will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 7 \u2013 Goodwill andIntangible Assets for furth\ner information.Intangible Assets, Net\nIntangible\n assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one  to 18 years. We reviewdefinite-lived\n intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment section. Refer toNote 7 \u2013 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for \nfurther information.85\n", "InvestmentsEquity Securities\nAccounting\n for our equity securities  varies depending on the marketability  of the security and the type of investment. Our marketable  equity securities  inpublicly\n traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investmentsin\n non-marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  cost,  with  remeasurements  to  fair  value  only  upon  the  occurrence  of  observable  price  changes  in  orderlytransactions\n for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess at each reporting period to determine whethernon-marketable\n equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.Non-marketable\n equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fairvalue\n on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities forimpairment\n at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include,but\n would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, asignificant\n adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,or\n a  completed  auction  process  for  the  same  or  similar  securities  for  an  amount  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  those  securities.  If  animpairment\n exists,  a  loss  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  value  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  theinvestment. We include \ninvestments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Debt Securities\nAccounting\n for  our  debt  securities  varies  depending  on  the  legal  form  of  the  security,  our  intended  holding  period  for  the  security,  and  the  nature  of  thetransaction.\n Investments  in  debt  securities  are  classified  as  available-for-sale  and  are  initially  recorded  at  fair  value.  Investments  in  marketable  debt  securitiesinclude\n commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds. As of December 31, 2020, certain investments in non-marketable equitysecurities\n with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale\n debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fairvalue recorded in earn\nings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.As\n of December 31, 2020, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyondone\n year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Certain investments in non-marketable debt securitiesclassified as available-for-sale de\nbt securities were included in investments on the consolidated balance sheet.Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-\nfor-sale Debt SecuritiesWe\n account  for  credit  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  in  accordance  with  ASC  326,  Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses  (\u201cASC  326\u201d).  Weadopted\n ASC  326  on  January  1,  2020,  on  a  modified  retrospective  basis.  Under  ASC  326,  at  each  reporting  period,  we  evaluate  our  available-for-sale  debtsecurities\n at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstanceswhere\n we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value andamortized\n cost  is  recognized  as  a  loss  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  with  a  corresponding  write-down  of  the  security\u2019s  amortized  cost.  Incircumstances\n where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether acredit\n loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, creditratings\n actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cashflows\n of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to thedifference between fair value\n and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustmentto net\n income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements inexpected cash flows due to imp\nrovements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method Investments\nInvestments\n in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controllingfinancial\n interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected. Investments accounted forunder\n the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to theinvestment\n balance, our proportionate share of the investees\u2019 net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences. We record our share of the results ofequity\n method investments one quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. Weevaluate\n each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or changes in business circumstances indicate thatthe carrying value of th\ne investment may not be fully recoverable. We recognize in the86\n", "consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, any required impairment loss. Evidence of a loss in value might include, butwould\n not  necessarily  be  limited  to,  absence  of  an  ability  to  recover  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  or  inability  of  the  investee  to  sustain  an  earningscapacity\n that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financialresults\n and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect thevalue of our investments.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\nWe\n evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amountof\n an asset or asset group (collectively, the \u201casset group\u201d) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carryingamount\n of  such  asset  groups  to  the  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  it  expects  the  asset  group  to  generate.  If  we  consider  the  asset  group  to  be  impaired,  theimpairment to be re\ncognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\nFair\n value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe\n measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used tomeasure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest pri\nority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and thelowest priority to unobservabl\ne inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    Level 1    Observable inputs such as quot\ned prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level\n 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that arenot active or inputs \nother than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which th\nere is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our\n primary  financial  instruments  include  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  investments,  accounts  payable,  accruedliabilities, long-t\nerm debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants. The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accountsreceivable,\n accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities  approximates  their  carrying  value  due  to  the  short-term  maturities  of  these  instruments.  Refer  to  Note  3  \u2013Investments and Fair Value Me\nasurement and Note 8 \u2013 Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest Entities\nWe\n evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex,involve judgment, and the use\n of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that anentity\n for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidatedfinancial\n statements.  The  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE  is  the  party  that  meets  both  of  the  following  criteria:  (1)  has  the  power  to  make  decisions  that  mostsignificantly\n affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  VIE;  and  (2)  has  the  obligation  to  absorb  losses  or  the  right  to  receive  benefits  that  in  either  case  couldpotentially\n be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination ofwhether\n we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interestsin a VIE in accordance with app\nlicable GAAP. Refer to Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.Revenue Recognition\nWe\n recognize  revenue  when  or  as  we  satisfy  our  obligations.  We  derive  our  revenues  principally  from  Drivers\u2019  and  Merchants\u2019  use  of  our  platform,  on-demand\n lead  generation,  and related  services,  including  facilitating  payments  from  end-users.  The service  enables  Drivers  and  Merchants  to  seek,  receive  andfulfill\n on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the \u201cUber Service\u201d). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we alsogenerate\n revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue fromcustomers' use of Freight serv\nices.We periodically re\nassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.87\n", "Mobility and Delivery AgreementsWe\n primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we chargeDrivers\n and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.The\n acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between usand the Drivers and Merchants \nafter the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The\n Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitat\ne the completion of a successful transaction.In\n 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation toDrivers,\n we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip iscomplete.\n We  present  revenue  on  a  net  basis  for  these  transactions,  as  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  by  Drivers  to  end-users.  For  the  years  endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized \ntotal revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.Additionally,\n during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for deliveryservices to end-users in those\n markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contractsshall\n be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,which\n represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-usersof\n $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions. For the year endedDecember\n 31,  2021,  we  recognized  revenue  from  end-users  of  $710  million  and  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  $2.4  billionassociated with these del\nivery transactions.In all\n markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, thisclass of end-users are not ou\nr customers.Principal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in\n determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentationof\n revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. \u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for otherparties\n to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. \u201cnet\u201d). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers andMerchants and discounts and promo\ntions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.For\n the  majority  of  Mobility  and  Delivery  transactions,  our  role  is  to  provide  the  Uber  Service  to  Drivers  and Merchants  to  facilitate  a  successful  trip  orDelivery\n service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchaseor\n otherwise obtain control of the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants toperform\n the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.\n As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsiblefor\n Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services. While we facilitate setting the price for Mobilityand\n Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does notresult in us controlling th\ne services provided to end-users.In\n the  vast  majority  of  transactions  with end-users,  we act  as  an agent  of  the  Driver  or  Merchant  by connecting  end-users  seeking  Mobility  and Deliveryservices\n with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services. Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfullycompleted transaction with end-users. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a\n net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing theservice\n to Drivers and Merchants. In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to providedelivery\n services.  In  these  markets,  we  are  the  principal  for  the  Delivery  services  and  present  Delivery  revenue  on  a  gross  basis  because  we  are  primarilyresponsible for the servi\nces.Mobility\nWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Rider\ns and successfullycomplete a trip via the Platf\norm. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.Depending\n on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amountpaid by an\n end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned byDrivers,\n end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing servicesprovided.\n Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of timefollowing the completion of \na trip.88\n", "In addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips. On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers. We generally collect ourservice fee\n from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods. As wecurrently\n have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, weconcluded\n collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidatedfinancial statements until collected\n from Drivers.Mobility revenue also inc\nludes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products and Vehicle Solutions.Delivery\nWe\n derive  our  Delivery  revenue  primarily  from  service  fees  paid  by  Couriers  and  Merchants  for  use  of  the  platform  and  related  service  to  successfullycomplete\n a meal delivery service on the platform. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as wellas select other goods. We r\necognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.In\n the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee paid by Couriers is the differencebetween\n the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers. End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while wepay\n Couriers based on time and distance for the delivery. Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction. Wetypically receive the service fee \nwithin a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.Freight\nWe\n derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers. With the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) during thefourth\n quarter  of  2021,  our  Freight  revenue  also  includes  revenue  from  transportation  management.  Refer  to  Note  18  \u2013  Business  Combinations  for  furtherinformation on the Transpl\nace acquisition.Brokerage\nBrokerage\n revenue  represents  the  gross  amount  of  fees  charged  to  Shippers  for  our  services  because  we  control  the  service  provided  to  customers.  Costsincurred\n with carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transportfreight.\n We  enter  into  contracts  with  Shippers  that  define  the  price  for  each  shipment  and  payment  terms.  Our  acceptance  of  the  shipment  request  establishesenforceable\n rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin todestination. We enter into separate\n contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless ofpayment\n by  the  Shipper.  We  invoice  the  Shipper  upon  satisfaction  of  our  sole  performance  obligation  to  transport  a  Shipper\u2019s  freight  using  our  network  ofindependent\n freight carriers. We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents our performance over theperiod\n of time a shipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end arenot material. Payment \nfor our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.Transportation Management\nWe\n provide  an  integrated  logistics  and  transportation  service,  which  can  include  shipment  planning,  freight  optimization,  carrier  assignment,  loadmanagement, freight audit and payment processing and other related transportation service\ns. Our sole performance obligation in these contracts is the integration ofthese\n services to transport the Shipper\u2019s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis. The majority of our transportation management revenue is recognized on a grossbasis\n in the amount of gross fees charged to Shippers upon satisfaction of our performance obligation because we control the service provided to customers. Costsincurred\n with  carriers  for  these  transactions  are  recorded  in  cost  of  revenue.  In  transactions  where  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  to  customers,  werecognize\n revenue on a net basis. Revenue is recognized as our performance obligation is satisfied, which generally represents the transit period from origin todestination\n by a third-party carrier. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end are notmaterial. Payment fo\nr our services is generally due within 30 to 60 days upon completion of our performance obligation.Principal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment\n is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Shippers. For each contract entered into with a Shipper wherewe\n are responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper's goods, we control the service before it is transferred to theShipper.\n We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract with the Shipper, including having discretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrierthat\n meets the Shipper's specifications. We also have pricing discretion and negotiate separately the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to carriers.Accordingly,\n we are the principal in these transactions. In certain arrangements, we do not control the service provided to customers and recognize the relatedrevenue on a net basis. Contracts where we do n\not control the service before it is transferred to the Shipper are not material for the years ended December 31, 2019,2020 and 2021.\n89\n", "All Other RevenueE-Bikes and E-Scooters\nPrior\n to the second quarter of 2020, All Other revenue (formerly our Other Bets segment) consisted primarily of revenue from New Mobility products, whichwere\n derived from operating leases as defined within ASC 842. New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a varietyof\n modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We wereresponsible for\n providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user\u2019s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of eachtrip.\n After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures fo\nr further information on the JUMP Divestiture.Advanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Rev\nenueIn\n 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next\u2013generation self-driving technology. Under thiscollaboration\n agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition andpresentation of the consid\neration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Non-Controlling Interests for further information.Incentives to Customers\nIncentives\n provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fairvalue\n of  the  good  or  service  received.  Incentives  to  customers  that  are  not  provided  in  exchange  for  a  distinct  good  or  service  are  evaluated  as  variableconsideration,\n in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Sinceincentives are earn\ned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring\n new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. Weexpense\n such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient underASC\n 340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.  The  amountrecorded\n as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is establishedusing\n amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,2019, 2020 and 2021 were immateria\nl.In\n some  transactions,  incentives  and  payments  made  to  customers  may  exceed  the  revenue  earned  in  the  transaction.  In  these  transactions,  the  resultingshortfall amount is re\ncorded as a reduction of revenue.Advertising Revenue\nWe\n derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.Advertising revenue is recognized\n when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in theamount billed to merchants\n as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.End-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discountsand promotions and include:\nTargeted end-user\n discounts and promotions: These  discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,or\n generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or mealdeliveries\n during  a  limited  time  period.  We  record  the  cost  of  these  discounts  and  promotions  to  end-users  who  are  not  our  customers  as  sales  and  marketingexpenses at the time th\ney are redeemed by the end-user.End-user referrals:\n These  referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platformand\n the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform. These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referringend-user.\n These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform. We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales andmarketing expenses at the\n time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.Market-wide\n promotions: These  promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants toend-users\n who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market. This also includes any discounts offered under oursubscription\n offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which enable End-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides.Accordingly, we record the cost o\nf these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the transaction is completed.90\n", "RefundsWe\n record refunds to end-users that we recover from Drivers and Merchants as a reduction of revenue. Refunds to end-users due to end-user dissatisfactionwith the Platform are r\necorded as marketing expenses and reduce the accounts receivable amount associated with the corresponding transaction.Other\nWe\n have elected  to exclude  from  revenue,  taxes  assessed by a governmental  authority  that  are both imposed  on and are  concurrent  with specific  revenueproducing transactions, and co\nllected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such amounts are not includedas a component of revenue or \ncost of revenue.Practical Expedients\nWe\n have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contractswith an original expected \nlength of one year or less. We have no significant financing components in our contracts with customers.Stock-Based Compensation\nWe\n account  for  stock-based  compensation  expense  in  accordance  with  the  fair  value  recognition  and  measurement  provisions  of  GAAP,  which  requirescompensation\n cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures when theyoccur.\n The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value,using appropriate valuat\nion techniques.Service-Based Awards\nWe\n record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSU(s)\u201d) on a straight-line basis over the requisiteservice period, which is gene\nrally four years.For stock options with service-based vesting\n conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under our employee stock purchase plan, the valuation model,typically\n the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interestrates.\n We  estimate  the  volatility  of  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant  based  on  the  weighted-average  historical  stock  price  volatility  of  our  own  shares  orcomparable\n publicly traded companies in our industry group. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant witha\n term equal to the expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be \u201cplain vanilla\u201doptions, as\n our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. We estimate the expectedterm\n for  non-employees\u2019  options  based  on  the  contractual  term.  U.S.  The  expected  dividend  yield  is  0.0%  as  we  have  not  paid  and  do  not  anticipate  payingdividends on our common stock.\nPerformance-Based Awards\nWe\n have granted restricted common stock awards (\u201cRSA(s)\u201d), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSAR(s)\u201d), stock options, and warrants that vest upon thesatisfaction\n of  both  service-based  and  performance-based  conditions.  The  service-based  condition  for  these  awards  generally  is  satisfied  over  four  years.  Theperformance-based\n conditions  generally  are  satisfied  upon  achieving  specified  performance  targets,  such  as  our  financial  or  operating  metrics,  and/or  theoccurrence\n of a qualifying event, defined as the earlier of (i) the closing of certain specific liquidation or change in control transactions, or (ii) an initial publicoffering\n (\u201cIPO\u201d).  We  record  stock-based  compensation  expense  for  performance-based  equity  awards  such  as  RSAs,  RSUs,  SARs,  and  stock  options  on  anaccelerated attribution method over\n the requisite service period, which is generally four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable tobe satisfied.\nPrior\n to  our  IPO  in  May  2019,  we  had  not  recognized  stock-based  compensation  expense  for  awards  with  performance-based  conditions  which  include  aqualifying\n event because the qualifying event described above had not yet occurred and was not considered probable. Upon the IPO, we recorded a cumulativeone-time\n stock-based compensation expense of $3.6 billion, determined using the grant-date fair values. Stock-based compensation related to remaining service-based awards after the IPO is r\necorded over the remaining requisite service period. Refer to Note 11 \u2013 Stockholders' Equity for further information on our IPO.For performance-based awa\nrds and RSUs, we determine the grant-date fair value to be the fair value of our common stock on the grant date.For performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we\n determine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model as described above for service-based awards.\n91\n", "Market-Based AwardsWe\n have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: service-based service conditions, performance-based\n conditions,  and/or  market-based  conditions.  The  service-based  condition  for  these  awards  generally  is  satisfied  over  four  years.  The  performance-basedconditions\n generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-based awards. The market-bas\ned conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.For\n market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions includingexpected\n stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimate thevolatility\n of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average  historical  stock price  volatility  of comparable  publicly-traded  companies  in itsindustry group.\n We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect atthe\n time of grant. Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock andestimated the expected capital raise\n percentage based on management's expectations at the time of measurement of the award's value.We\n record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over therequisite\n service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. We determine the requisite service period by comparingthe\n derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisiteservice period.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d)\nWe recognize stock-bas\ned expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The ESPP provides fortwelve-month\n offering  periods,  and  each  offering  period  includes  two  purchase  periods  of  approximately  six  months.  The  ESPP  allows  eligible  employees  topurchase\n shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimatethe\n fair  value  of  shares  to  be  issued  under  the  ESPP  based  on  a  combination  of  options  valued using  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model.  In  2019,  wedetermine\n volatility over an expected term of six months based on our historical volatility and twelve months based on the average of our historical volatility andour\n peer group. In 2020 and 2021, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimatethe expected term based o\nn the contractual term.Common Stock Fair Value\nSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair va\nlue of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.Prior\n to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensivebusiness,\n finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculatingstock-based\n compensation  expense.  We  obtained  contemporaneous  third-party  valuations  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in  determining  fair  value.  Thesecontemporaneous\n third-party  valuations  used  the  methodologies,  approaches  and  assumptions  consistent  with  the  American  Institute  of  Certified  PublicAccountants Practice Guide, \nValuation of Privately-Held -Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Income Taxes\nWe\n account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected futuretax consequences of events th\nat have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.We\n account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax positionwhen\n it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe technical merits. Income tax\n positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.We\n recognize  accrued  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  in  the  provision  for  (benefit  from)  income  taxes  in  the  consolidatedstatements of operations.\nValuation\n allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized basedon the\n weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of theappropriate\n character  (for  example,  ordinary  income  or  capital  gain)  within  the  carryback  or  carryforward  periods  available  under  the  applicable  tax  law.  Weregularly\n review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversalsof existing\n temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future marketconditions\n and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred taxassets, our income tax provis\nion would increase or decrease in the period in92\n", "which the assessment is changed. We elected the tax law ordering approach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future GlobalIntangible Low-taxed Incom\ne (\u201cGILTI\u201d).We have elected to t\nreat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.The\n establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions todetermine the\n fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenueand expense forecasts, the\n estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expectedfuture cash flows to present value are\n derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.Although\n we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and externalcomparable\n data  and  are  inherently  uncertain.  Unanticipated  events  and  circumstances  may  occur  that  could  affect  either  the  accuracy  or  validity  of  suchassumptions, estimates or \nactual results.Expenses\nSet forth below is a brief des\ncription of the components of our expenses:\u2022\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily  consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings,credit\n card  processing  fees,  bank  fees,  data  center  and  networking  expenses,  mobile  device  and  service  costs,  costs  incurred  for  certain  Deliverytransactions where\n we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freighttransportation servic\nes, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses.\u2022\nOperations and support expenses primarily  consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations incities,\n including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost ofcustomer support, Driver backg\nround checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\u2022\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of co mpensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertisingcosts,\n product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and theallocation\n of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred. Advertising expenses totaled $1.3 billion,$1.0\n billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, andcredits\n provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.5 billion, $2.0 billion, and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and2021, respectively.\n\u2022\nResearch and development expenses primarily  consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, designand product development. Expenses inclu\ndes ATG and Other Technology Programs development expenses prior to the divestiture of our ATG business inJanuary 2021, as\n well as expenses associated with ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certaincorporate costs.\n\u2022\nGeneral  and  administrative  expenses primarily  consist  of  compensation  costs,  including  stock-based  compensation,  for  executive  management  andadministrative employees, including finance\n and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as wellas\n allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legalsettlements.\n\u2022\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily  consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software,leasehold improvements, \nfurniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets.Restructuring and Related Charges\nCosts\n associated  with  management-approved  restructuring  activities,  including  reductions  in  headcount,  exiting  a  market  or  consolidation  of  facilities  arerecognized when\n they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-lived assets (including impairment of operating lease right-of-use\n assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease cost for right-of-use assets that ceased to be used. We record a liability for employee terminationbenefits\n either  when  it  is probable  that  an employee  is entitled  to them  and the  amount  of the  benefits  can  be reasonably  estimated  or  when management  hascommunicated\n the  termination  plan  to employees  and all  of the  following  conditions  have  been  met:  management,  having  the  authority  to approve  the  action,commits\n to  a  plan  of  termination;  the  plan  identifies  the  number  of  employees  to  be  terminated,  their  job  classifications  and  their  locations,  and  the  expectedcompletion\n date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefitsthey will receive if \nthey are involuntarily terminated; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will bemade\n or that the plan will be withdrawn. We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with thecontract terms. Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remainin\ng term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic benefits to us are recognizedat\n the  cease-use  date.  Costs  associated  with  lease  contracts  are  accounted  for  under  the  leasing  accounting  guidance  or  under  the  long-lived  assets  accountingguidance.\n93\n", "Restructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are classified based on ourclassification\n policy  for  each  category  of  operating  expense.  Personnel  costs  are  classified  based  on  each  employee\u2019s  classification,  lease  costs  (includingimpairments of right-of-use\n assets) are classified in the same expense line item where each lease\u2019s rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-livedassets are recorded with\nin general and administrative expenses.Foreign Currency\nThe\n functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries\u2019 activities. Monetary assetsand\n liabilities, and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate ineffect\n at the end of the period and are recorded in the current period consolidated statement of operations. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement arerecorded\n in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilitieswith\n non-U.S.  dollar  functional  currencies  are  translated  at  the  month-end  rate,  retained  earnings  and  other  equity  items  are  translated  at  historical  rates,  andrevenues\n and  expenses  are  translated  at  average  exchange  rates  during  the  year.  Cumulative  translation  adjustments  are  recorded  within  accumulated  othercomprehensive income (los\ns), a separate component of total equity (deficit).Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe\n compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available tocommon stockholders\n for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as ifall income for the pe\nriod had been distributed.Our restricted common stock, and\n common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider restricted common stockand\n any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitabledividend rights in the event \na cash dividend is declared on common stock.Prior\n to  conversion  to  common  stock  upon  our  IPO,  the  holders  of  the  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  would  have  been  entitled  to  dividends  inpreference\n to common shareholders, at specified rates, if declared. Then any remaining earnings would be distributed to the holders of common stock, restrictedcommon\n stock,  common  stock  issued  upon  early  exercise  of  stock  options,  and  the  holders  of  the  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  on  a  pro-rata  basisassuming\n conversion of all redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock. These participating securities did not contractually require the holders ofsuch shares to participa\nte in our losses.Insurance Reserves\nWe\n use a combination  of third-party  insurance  and self-insurance  mechanisms,  including  a wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary,  to provide  for  thepotential\n liabilities  for  certain  risks,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and  underinsured  motorist,  auto  physical  damage,  general  liability,  and  workers\u2019compensation.\n The  insurance  reserves  is  the  liability  for  unpaid  losses  and  loss  adjustment  expenses,  which  represents  the  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaidobligation\n for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of thebalance\n sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. Inaddition, we use assumptions based on actuarial\n judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends,severity\n trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.Adjustments, if\n any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations. Reserve amounts estimated to be settledwithin\n one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated balancesheets.\nWhile\n management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. Allestimates\n of  ultimate  losses  and  allocated  loss  adjustment  expenses,  and  of  resulting  reserves,  are  subject  to  inherent  variability  caused  by  the  nature  of  theinsurance\n claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual resultsdepend upon\n the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,and\n social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from theestimate provided on the \nconsolidated balance sheets.Loss Contingencies\nWe\n are  involved  in  legal  proceedings,  claims,  and  regulatory,  indirect  tax  examinations  or  government  inquiries  and  investigations  that  may  arise  in  theordinary\n course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability whenwe\n believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible andthe loss or range of loss can be \nreasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.94\n", "We  review the  developments  in our contingencies  that  could affect  the  amount of the  provisions that  have  been  previously  recorded,  and the matters  andrelated\n reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed.  We  make  adjustments  to  our  provisions  and  changes  to  our  disclosures  accordingly  to  reflect  the  impact  ofnegotiations,\n settlements,  rulings, advice  of legal  counsel, and updated information.  Significant  judgment  is required  to determine  both the probability  and theestimated amount of loss.\nThe\n outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolvedagainst\n us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reportingperiod in which any such outcome be\ncomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.We recognize estim\nated losses from contingencies that relate to proceedings in which Drivers are the plaintiffs, or proceedings and regulatory penalties againstDrivers\n for  which  we  elect  to  either  pay  on  behalf  of  or  reimburse  Drivers,  as  a  reduction  of  revenue  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  All  otherestimated losses from \ncontingencies are recognized in general and administrative expenses.Legal fees and other costs \nassociated with such actions are expensed as incurred.Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn\n January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, \u201cInvestments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments\u2014Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323),and\n Derivatives  and  Hedging  (Topic  815):  Clarifying  the  Interactions  between  Topic  321,  Topic  323,  and  Topic  815,\u201d  which  clarifies  the  interaction  of  theaccounting\n for equity investments under Topic 321 and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in Topic 323 and the accounting forcertain\n forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under Topic 815.

Level  1  instrument  valuations  are  based  on  quoted  market  prices  of  the  identicalunderlying\n security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in lessactive\n markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniquesdue to the absence of quoted m\narket prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.Our\n Level  3  non-marketable  debt  securities  and  non-marketable  equity  securities  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2021  primarily  consist  of  common  stockinvestments and redeemable \npreferred stock investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.Depending\n on  the  investee\u2019s  financing  activity  in  a  reporting  period,  management\u2019s  estimate  of  fair  value  may  be  primarily  derived  from  the  investee\u2019sfinancing\n transactions,  such  as  the  issuance  of  preferred  stock  to  new  investors.  The  price  in  these  transactions  generally  provides  the  best  indication  of  theenterprise\n value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information byusing other valuation techn\niques, including the(1)(1) \n98\n", "guideline  public  company  approach.  The  guideline  public  company  approach  relies  on  publicly  available  market  data  of  comparable  companies  and  usescomparative\n valuation  multiples  of the investee\u2019s  revenue  (actual  and forecasted),  and therefore,  unobservable  input used in this valuation  technique primarilyconsists of short-term r\nevenue projections.Once\n the  fair  value  of  the  investee  is  estimated,  an  option-pricing  model  (\u201cOPM\u201d),  a  common  stock  equivalent  (\u201cCSE\u201d)  method  or  a  hybrid  approach  isemployed\n to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around theinvestees\u2019 expected time to li\nquidity and volatility.An\n increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, couldresult\n in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, andvolatility\n are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In thefuture, depending on the weight of \nevidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.We determine rea\nlized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.Didi Investment\nOn June 30, 2021, Didi started trading on the New York Stock Ex\nchange. Accordingly, our investment in preferred shares of Didi, which was previouslyaccounted for under the\n measurement alternative on a non-recurring basis, was converted to ordinary shares with a readily determinable fair value and thereforechanged to an investment m\neasured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Our investment is subject to a lock-up period in which our ability to sell is restricted until July 2022.Aurora Investment\nOn\n January 19, 2021, we completed  the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora. As consideration  for the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora, we receivedcommon stock in Aurora. Concurrent\nly, we invested in Aurora\u2019s preferred stock. For further information, refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures.We\n held one seat on Aurora\u2019s board of directors and had the ability to hold a second seat, which, along with our common and preferred stock ownership (our\u201cAurora\n Investments\u201d) generate significant influence. We elected to apply the fair value option to our Aurora common stock and preferred stock investments inorder\n to provide  consistency  of accounting  treatment  to our Aurora  Investments.

Upon the completion of the merger, all of our Aurora Investments converted into shares of thenewly\n issued Class A common stock of the publicly traded  company. In addition,  our ownership was significantly  diluted and we lost the ability to appoint asecond\n seat on Aurora\u2019s board of directors. As a result, we no longer held significant influence over Aurora. As of December 31, 2021, our Aurora Investment hasbeen classified as a marketable\n equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table presenting our financial assets and liabilities measured atfair value on a recur\nring basis.We\n recognized an unrealized gain of $1.6 billion on this investment in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations for the yearended December 31, 2021.\n99\n", "Summarized financial information for Aurora for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the most recent period available, is as follows (in millions):Results of Operations Data\nNine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2021\nRevenue\n$ 55 Total operating expenses\n557 Loss from operations\n(502) Net loss\n(504) Balance Sheet Data\nAs of September 30, 2021 Current assets\n$ 665 Total assets\n2,671 Current liabilities\n75 Total liabilities\n219 Redeemable convertibl\ne preferred stock2,161 Grab Investment\nOn\n December 1, 2021, Grab completed its planned SPAC merger with Altimeter Growth Corporation, resulting in Grab becoming a publicly traded companypost combination. Upon the comple\ntion of the merger, our investment in Series G preferred shares of Grab, which was previously accounted for as an investment inan\n available-for-sale debt security due to the redemption feature of the shares, converted into the newly issued Class A ordinary shares of the publicly tradedcompany. We recorded the fair value\n of our investment with changes in the fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax through the date ofthe\n conversion.  Upon  the  conversion,  we  released  the  accumulative  pre-tax  unrealized  gains  on  the  investment  of  $2.8  billion  recorded  through  othercomprehensive\n income  and  recognized  them  as  unrealized  gains  in  other  income  (expense),  net  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  operations  for  year  endedDecember\n 31,  2021.  Subsequent  to  the  conversion,  we  recognized  unrealized  losses  of  $1.2  billion  on  the  investment  in  other  income  (expense),  net  in  ourconsolidated statemen\nt of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the fair value change of the equity security.As of December 31, 2021, our Grab investmen\nt has been classified as a marketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the tablepresenting our financia\nl assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.The\n following  table  summarizes  information  about  the  significant  unobservable  inputs  used  in  the  fair  value  measurement  for  our  Grab  investment  as  ofDecember 31, 2020:\nFair value method\nRelative weighting Key unobservable input Financing transactions\n100% Transaction price per share $6.16 Volatility\n53% Estimated time to liquidity\n1.75 years During\n the first quarter of 2020, we determined the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities in Grab had declined below their amortized cost basedon\n an analysis of the observed valuation declines of Grab\u2019s publicly-traded competitive peer group and representative stock market indices. These observed inputswere\n considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities. Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that wasapplied\n to  the  valuation  derived  from  Grab\u2019s  latest  financing  transaction  which  occurred  earlier  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  and  prior  to  the  announcement  ofCOVID-19\n as  a  global  pandemic,  impacting  global  demand  for  Mobility  services.  As  a  result,  the  carrying  value  of  the  investment  in  Grab  was  reduced  by$230\n million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million,representing\n the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balancesheet\n and  a  corresponding  credit-related  impairment  charge  recorded  to  other  income  (expense),  net  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations.  Due  to  thesignificant\n uncertainty  about Grab\u2019s ability  to repay the redemption  amount of the securities  on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected  wasconsidered\n to be less than the fair value of the securities. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2020, the entire decline in fair value below amortized cost wasconsidered to reflect a credit-related\n impairment charge.The\n fair value of our Grab investment recovered during the third quarter of 2020 as determined by referencing an equity financing transaction closed by theinvestee during that quar\nter. As a result, we recognized a reversal of the previously recorded allowance for100\n", "credit loss in the consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding reversal of the credit-related impairment charge to other income (expense), net in the consolidatedstatement of operations.\nLime Investments\nOur\n ownership in Lime is comprised of Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note(collectively,\n the \u201c2020 Lime Investments\u201d). The 2020 Lime Investments were received as part of the transaction by which we divested of our JUMP business.Refer\n to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures for further information regarding the JUMP Divestiture and the 2020 Lime Investments. Our investment in Lime Common Stockand\n representation on Lime\u2019s board of directors gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over Lime. We elected to apply the fair value option to ourLime\n Common  Stock  investment  and  therefore  we  are  applying  fair  value  accounting  to  all  of  the  2020  Lime  Investments  which  provides  for  consistency  ofaccounting treatment.\n The 2020 Lime Investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. The fair value ofthe\n 2020 Lime Investments as of December 31, 2020 of $134 million was determined by referencing a transaction in a convertible note that is junior to the LimeConvertible Note\n and used as an input to an OPM. Other key inputs to the OPM were discount rates of 22% and 28%, volatility of 67% and time to liquidity of 2.0years.\nIn\n December 2021, we contributed an additional $50 million of cash to Lime in exchange for a second convertible secured note that may be converted intocommon\n or  preferred  stock.  The  fair  value  of  our  Lime  investments  as  of  December  31,  2021  of  $162  million  was  determined  by  referencing  a  financingtransaction\n and used as an input to an OPM.

For further information, see the section titled \u201cAurora Investment\u201d and \u201cGrab Investment\u201d above.We did not make any transf\ners between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year ended December 31, 2020.Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nNon-Financial Assets\nOur\n non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized.Such fair value measure\nments are based predominately on Level 3 inputs.Non-Marketable Equity Securi\ntiesOur\n non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values, and primarily related to Didi priorto\n Didi\u2019s IPO on June 30, 2021. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions ofidentical\n or similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded withinother income (expense), n\net in the101\n", "consolidated statements of operations. Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair valueof these securities based\n on valuation methods, including the common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securitiesissued by the investee adjust\ned for contractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.The\n following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses from remeasurement (referred to as upward or downward adjustments) recorded in other income(expense),\n net in the consolidated statements of operations, and included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities held during theyears\n ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 based on the observable price in an orderly transaction for the same or similar security of the same issuers (inmillions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020 2021 Upward adjustments\n$ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 71 Downward adjustments (including imp\nairment)\u2014 (1,690) \u2014 Total unrealized gain \n(loss) for non-marketable equity securities$ \u2014 $ (1,690) $ 71 We\n evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potentialimpairment\n indicators.  This evaluation  consists  of  several  factors  including,  but  not limited  to,  an assessment  of a  significant  adverse  change  in  the  economicenvironment,\n significant  adverse  changes  in  the  general  market  condition  of  the  geographies  and  industries  in  which  our  investees  operate,  and  other  publiclyavailable\n information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities. As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising fromCOVID-19,\n we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, wasless than their carry\ning value.To\n determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,weighted\n at  80%  and  20%,  respectively.  The  CSE  method  assumes  an  if-converted  scenario,  where  the  OPM  approach  allocates  equity  value  to  individualsecurities\n within  the  investees\u2019  capital  structure  based  on  contractual  rights  and  preferences.  We  computed  a  range  of  market  adjustments  based  on  observedmarket\n valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securitiesoccurred\n in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs areconsidered\n indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from thelatest\n financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.A\n lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes ofallocating value in th\ne OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event wouldresult\n in  higher  valuation  (due  to  access  to  public  markets  and  reduction  in  cost  of  capital),  reduces  valuation  uncertainty,  and  generally  assumes  market  andmacro-economic\n conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, werecorded an impairm\nent charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020. There wasno remeasurement even\nt for our investment in Didi that occurred during the remainder of 2020.The following table summar\nizes information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation for our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020:Fair value method\nKey unobservable input CSE\nMarket adjustment (20)% OPM\nVolatility 39% Estimated time to liquidity\n2.0 years Market adjustment\n(40)% During\n the first quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of $500 million of our Didi shares and realized immaterial gains from this transaction. In addition, werecorded\n unrealized gains of $71 million from remeasurement of the carrying value of the remaining Didi shares under the measurement alternative during thethree months ended March 31, 2021.\nWe\n did not record any realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years endedDecember 31, 2019 and 2020.\n102\n", "The following table summarizes the total carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis held as ofDecember 31, 2020 and 2021 including cumu\nlative unrealized upward and downward adjustments made to the initial cost basis of the securities (in millions):As of December 31,\n2020\n2021 Initial cost basis\n$ 6,282 $ 279 Upward adjustments\n1,984 4 Downward adjustments (including imp\nairment)(1,690) \u2014 Total carrying value a\nt the end of the period$ 6,576 $ 283 Note 4 - Equity Method Investments\nThe carrying value of our equ\nity method investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):As of December 31,\n2020\n2021 MLU B.V.\n$ 1,001 $ 751 Mission Bay 3 & 4 \n41 38 Other\n37 11 Equity method investments\n$ 1,079 $ 800 Refer to Note 16 \u2013 Variable Int\nerest Entities for further information.MLU B.V. and Uber Russia/CIS Operations\nDuring\n 2018, we closed a transaction that contributed the net assets of our Uber Russia/CIS operations into a newly formed private limited liability company(\u201cMLU\n B.V.\u201d  or  \u201cYandex.Taxi  joint  venture\u201d),  with  Yandex  and  us  holding  ownership  interests  in  MLU  B.V.

Certain contingent equity issuancesof MLU B.V. may dilute our equity owner\nship interest to approximately 33%. The investment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our abilityto exercise\n significant influence over MLU B.V. The initial fair value of our equity method investment in MLU B.V. was estimated using discounted cash flows ofMLU B.V. The equity ownership interest in MLU B.V. was 35% and 29% as of De\ncember 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.2020\nDuring\n 2020, Yandex contributed its Yandex.Carsharing business (\u201cDrive\u201d) into MLU B.V. in exchange for an additional equity interest.

Call Option\nThe\n MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, initially valued at $230 millionand measured\n at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Theexercise\n price  of  the  MLU  B.V.  Call  Option  is  approximately  $1.8  billion,  subject  to  certain  adjustments  based  on  the  timing  of  the  option  exercise.  As  ofDecember\n 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million, including the recognition of an immaterial gain for the fair value change duringthe\n year ended December 31, 2021. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulatedmultiple\n scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were underlyingbusiness value, option term of 1.7 y\nears, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price (Level 3).MLU B.V. Basis Difference\nIncluded\n in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionateshare\n of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V.and\n amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translationadjustments represent\ning fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar.The table below provides the co\nmposition of the basis difference as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):As of December 31, 2021\nEquity method goodwill\n$ 545 Intangible assets, net \nof accumulated amortization54 Deferred tax liabilities\n(12) Cumulative currency tr\nanslation adjustments(107) Basis difference\n$ 480 We\n amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line\n method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 4.0 years and 3.3 years as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Equitymethod\n goodwill  is not  amortized.  The  investment  balance  is reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  factors  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of the  equity  methodinvestment\n may not be recoverable.

We contributed $136 millioncash\n in exchange for a 45% interest in ECOP. The two LLC Partners own 45% and 10%, respectively. The equity ownership interest in ECOP remained at 45% asof December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nIn\n March 2020, the two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries took out new loans. Upon closing of the new financing, the proceeds were used to first pay off theexisting construction\n loan, then to cover the required operation reserve as well as various financing costs, and last, the remaining  proceeds were distributed back toUber\n and the LLC Partners based on their ownership percentage. As a result, Uber received $91 million from the ECOP as a return of capital investment, andreduced the investment \ncarrying value by the same amount.We\n have significant influence over ECOP and we account for our investment in ECOP under the equity method. At each reporting period and a quarter inarrears,\n we adjust the carrying value of our investment to reflect our proportionate share of ECOP\u2019s income or loss, and any impairments, with a correspondingcredit\n or  debit,  respectively,  to  income  or  loss  from  equity  method  investment,  net  of  tax  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  During  2019,  theconstruction\n was completed and leasing activities commenced. and immaterial amounts of equity earnings were recognized during 2019, 2020 and 2021. During2020 and\n 2021, we incurred an immaterial amount of lease payments with ECOP, which is a related party.

The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid specialinterest.\nUpon\n conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash andshares of\n our common stock, at our election. We may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, atour\n option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for atleast\n 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, andincluding,\n the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amountof the notes to be redeem\ned, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.The\n indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, theincurrence of indebtedn\ness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries.Prior\n to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recordedas\n equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liabilitycomponent\n (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equitycomponent\n of  the  2025  Convertible  Notes  was  included  in  additional  paid-in  capital  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  was  notremeasured\n as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes asof the pricing date, we used th\ne binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.Effective\n January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease toadditional paid-in capital\n of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to theopening\n accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 ConvertibleNotes as a single liabili\nty measured at its amortized cost.The\n fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are notactive, which is considered \na Level 2 valuation input.Senior Notes\nIn\n October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November 1, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Senior Notes\u201d) and eight-year\n notes  with  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $1.5  billion  due  on  November  1,  2026  (the  \u201c2026  Senior  Notes\u201d)  in  a  private  placement  offering  totaling  $2.0billion.\n We issued the 2023 and 2026 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately $9 million for debt issuance costs.

The  redomiciliation  resulted  in  a  step-up  in  the  tax  basis  of  intellectual  property  rights  and  a  correlated  increase  in  foreigndeferred\n tax assets in an amount of $6.4 billion, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion (refer to the 2019 rate impact for \u201cChange inunrecognized\n tax benefits\u201d). Based on available objective evidence, management believed it was not more-likely-than-not that these additional foreigndeferred\n tax assets will be realizable as of December 31, 2019 and, therefore, were offset by a full valuation allowance (refer to the 2019 rate impact for\u201cValuation\n allowance\u201d)  to  the  extent  not  offset  by  reserves  for  uncertain  tax  positions.  The corresponding  deferred  tax  asset  and valuation  allowancebalance were included in \nthe \u201cFixed assets and intangible assets\u201d and \u201cValuation allowance\u201d lines, respectively, in the table below.In\n the  second  quarter  of  2020,  we  transferred  certain  intangible  assets  among  our  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  to  align  our  structure  to  our  evolvingoperations.\n The  transaction  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  deferred  tax  assets  of  $354  million;  however,  there  was  no  financial  statement  benefitrecognized since the de\nferred tax asset was offset by a full valuation allowance.To\n align our structure to our evolving operations, in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangibleassets.

In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferredtax\n assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporarydifferences\n and  tax  planning  strategies  by  jurisdiction.  Our  judgment  regarding  future  profitability  may  change  due  to  many  factors,  including  future  marketconditions\n and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred taxassets,\n our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferredtax\n assets  of  $13.4  billion  and  $13.9  billion  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2021,  respectively.  In  2021,  the  increase  in  the  valuation  allowance  was  primarilyattributable\n to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations,and\n tax  credits  generated  during  the  year,  offset  partially  by  the  release  of  the  valuation  allowance  due  to  deferred  tax  liabilities  recorded  as  a  result  of  theacquisitions providing an addi\ntional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.The\n indefinite  carryforward  period  for  net  operating  losses  (\"NOLs\")  means  that  indefinite-lived  deferred  tax  liabilities  can  be  considered  as  support  forrealization of deferred tax assets, which can\n affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,we\n realized approximately $744 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferredtax liabilities be\ning used as a source of income.As\n of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  U.S.  federal  NOL  carryforwards  of  $3.2  billion  that  begin  to  expire  in  2031  and  $11.7  billion  that  have  an  unlimitedcarryover\n period.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,we\n had  recorded  aggregate  liabilities  of  $1.8  billion  and  $2.2  billion,  respectively,  of  which  $1.3  billion  and  $1.3  billion  relate  to  non-income  tax  matters,respectively,\n in  accrued  and  other  current  liabilities  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  for  all  of  our  legal,  regulatory  and  non-income  tax  matters  that  wereprobable and reasonably est\nimable.We\n are  currently  party  to  various  legal  and  regulatory  matters  that  have  arisen  in  the  normal  course  of  business  and  include,  among  others,  allegedindependent\n contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims,unfair\n competition  claims,  intellectual  property  claims,  employment  discrimination  and  other  employment-related  claims,  Telephone  Consumer  Protection  Act(\u201cTCPA\u201d)\n claims,  Americans  with Disabilities  Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims,  data  and privacy  claims,  securities  claims,  antitrust  claims,  challenges  to regulations,  andother\n matters. We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative andaudit\n proceedings,  asserting  claims  by  or  on  behalf  of  Drivers  that  Drivers  are  misclassified  as  independent  contractors.  In  connection  with  the  enactment  ofCalifornia\n State Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number ofmisclassification\n claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount orrange\n of reasonably  possible loss will not, either  individually  or in the aggregate,  have a material  adverse  effect  on our business, financial  position, results  ofoperations,\n or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matterswere\n resolved  against  us  for  amounts  in  excess  of  management's  expectations,  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows  could  be  materiallyadversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn\n January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\u201cABC\u201d\n test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workersperforming\n services  for  a  hiring  entity  are  considered  employees  unless  the  hiring  entity  can  demonstrate  three  things:  the  worker  (A)  is  free  from  the  hiringentity\u2019s\n control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work ortype of business performed fo\nr the hiring entity.On\n May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint inSan\n Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damagesrelated to the alleged competitive\n advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On\n August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the\n Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed apetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Co\nurt. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November2020, and requested that the Court o\nf Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.Proposition\n 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result ofthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers \nare able to maintain their status as independent contractors127\n", "under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16,2020.\nThe\n California  Supreme  Court  declined  the  petition  for  review  on  February  10,  2021.  The  lawsuit  was  returned  to  the  trial  court  following  the  appellateproceedings on February 22, 20\n21. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a stipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction withthe\n trial  court.  On  April  16,  2021,  the  trial  court  signed  an  order  granting  the  stipulation.  Although  the  preliminary  injunction  has  been  dissolved,  the  lawsuitremains\n ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22. We have petitioned to stay this matterpending\n coordination  with  other  California  employment  related  matters,  which  was  granted  and  a  coordination  judge  was  assigned.  We  intend  to  continue  tovigorously defend ourselves. Our chan\nces of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.In\n addition,  in  January  2021,  a  petition  was  filed  with  the  California  Supreme  Court  by  several  drivers  and  a  labor  union  alleging  that  Proposition  22  isunconstitutional,\n which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, theAlameda\n County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision withthe California Court of Appeal, \nand the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization has also filed an appeal.Massachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit\nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney Gene\nral filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The complaint alleges Driversare\n employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss thecomplaint\n on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021. A summary judgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion inwhich we argue that the motion is premature. The court granted our motio\nn to defer the summary judgment motion on January 12, 2022. Our chances of success onthe merits are sti\nll uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.Swiss Social Security Reclassi\nficationSeveral\n Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or ofUber\n B.V. for social security or regulatory purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, aruling\n was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser OperationsB.V.\n are still  pending for  years  2014 to 2019. In January  2022, the  Social Security  Tribunal  of Zurich  reclassified  drivers  who have  used the App in 2014 asdependent\n workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and hasno\n impact on our current operations. The ultimate resolution of the social security matters for the other two entities is uncertain and the amount accrued for thismatter is recorded within accr\nued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.\nOn\n October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting thatthey\n should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. Thetribunal ruled\n on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment ofthe\n App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing atthe Supreme Court took place in Ju\nly 2020.On\n February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment lawpurposes. Damages include back pay \nincluding holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing in July 2022.On\n March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wagewhen driving with Uber.\n They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed asettlement\n process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register fora\n settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  have  extended  offers  to  all  drivers  eligible  forsettlement\n who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take placein\n 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, andholiday pay.\nOn\n June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed theenrollment\n of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan. While the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, we have recorded an accrual for thesematters within accru\ned and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021.128\n", "Other Driver Classification MattersAdditionally, we\n have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,administrative\n actions,  and  government  investigations  and  audits  challenging  our  classification  of  Drivers  as  independent  contractors  and  not  employees.  Webelieve\n that our current and historical approach to classification is supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.However,\n the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, couldhave\n a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of thesematters\n can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and otherfactors.\nState Unemployment Taxes\nIn\n 2018,  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Labor  (\u201cNJDOL\u201d)  opened  an  audit  reviewing  whether  Drivers  were  independent  contractors  or  employees  forpurposes\n of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019,against\n both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interestsowed\n from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principalrevised\n amount of the assessment and are engaged in ongoing discussions with the NJDOL about the assessments. While the ultimate resolution of this matter isuncertain, we recorded fo\nr this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.Google v. Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski\nOn\n October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach oftheir\n respective  employment  agreements  with  Google,  fraud  and  other  state  law  violations  (due  to  soliciting  Google  employees  and  starting  a  new  venture  tocompete with Google\u2019s business in contraventio\nn of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March26, 2019, following a hearing, the\n arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million againstAnthony\n Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted itsrequest\n for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron andGoogle\n entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Googleon\n behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber\u2019s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.Whether\n Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.In\n March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from thetrade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levando\nwski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed toperform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking\n, LLC. For these claims, Uber and Levandowski reached a confidential settlement in principle that isscheduled\n for an approval hearing with the court on March 3, 2022. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, we have recorded for this matterwithin accrued and other cu\nrrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.Non-Income Tax Matters\nWe recorded an estimated liability\n for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities withregard\n to such matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well asthe tax\n treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involvethe\n applicability  of  transactional  taxes  (such  as  sales,  value  added  and  similar  taxes)  to  services  provided,  as  well  as  the  applicability  of  withholding  tax  onpayments made to such Drivers.\nWe\n are involved in a proceeding in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify us as a transportation provider. Beingclassified\n as  a  transportation  provider  would  result  in  a  VAT  (20%)  on  Gross  Bookings  or  on  the  service  fee  that  we  charge  Drivers,  both  retroactively  andprospectively.\n HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and HMRC is also expected toconsider\n the U.K. Supreme Court\u2019s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers\u2019 worker classification, in determining whether we should be classified as a provider oftransportation\n services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a satisfactory resolution afterexhausting\n HMRC\u2019s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the U.K. Tax Court, which may require the up-front payment tothe Tax Court (\u201cpay-to-play\n\u201d) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow. We continue to believe that we have meritorious defense in these proceedings.Our\n estimated  liability  is  inherently  subjective  due  to  the  complexity  and  uncertainty  of  these  matters  and  the  judicial  processes  in  certain  jurisdictions,therefore, the final outcome c\nould be different from the estimated liability recorded.129\n", "Other Legal and Regulatory MattersWe\n have  been  subject  to  various  government  inquiries  and  investigations  surrounding  the  legality  of  certain  of  our  business  practices,  compliance  withantitrust,\n Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  other  global  regulatory  requirements,  labor  laws,  securities  laws,  data  protection  and  privacy  laws,  consumerprotection\n laws,  environmental  laws,  and  the  infringement  of  certain  intellectual  property  rights.  We  have  investigated  many  of  these  matters  and  we  areimplementing a\n number of recommendations to our managerial, operational and compliance practices, as well as strengthening our overall governance structure. Inmany cases,\n we are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of these inquiries and investigations on our business which could be time consuming, costly toinvestigate\n and require significant management attention. Furthermore, the outcome of these inquiries and investigations could negatively impact our business,reputation, financia\nl condition and operating results, including possible fines and penalties and requiring changes to operational activities and procedures.Indemnifications\nIn\n the ordinary course of business, we often include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties. Pursuant to these provisions,we\n may  be  obligated  to  indemnify  such  parties  for  losses  or  claims  suffered  or  incurred  in  connection  with  their  activities  or  non-compliance  with  certainrepresentations\n and  warranties  made  by  us.  In  addition,  we  have  entered  into  indemnification  agreements  with  our  officers,  directors,  and  certain  current  andformer\n employees,  and  our  certificate  of  incorporation  and  bylaws  contain  certain  indemnification  obligations.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximumpotential loss under these \nindemnification provisions / obligations because of the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities\nVIEs are legal entities that\n lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support.Consolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we ha\nve the power to directthe\n activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs. As a result, we consolidate the assets and liabilities of these consolidatedVIEs.\nTotal\n assets included on the consolidated balance sheets for our consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $1.2 billion and $3.9 billion,respectively.\n Total  liabilities  included  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  for  these  VIEs  as  of  December  31,  2020  were  not  material  and  $1.0  billion  as  ofDecember 31, 2021.\nFreight Holding\nIn\n July  2018,  we  created  a  new  majority-owned  subsidiary,  Uber  Freight  Holding  Corporation  (\u201cFreight  Holding\u201d).  The  purpose  of  Freight  Holding  is  toperform the business act\nivities of the Freight operating segment. The Freight Holding stock held by us was determined to be a variable interest.In\n October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a Series A preferred stock purchase agreement (\u201c2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d)with outside investor (\u201c2020 Freigh\nt Series A Investor\u201d) to sell shares of Series A Preferred Stock (\u201cFreight Series A\u201d).In July 2021, we entered into a\n Freight Series A preferred stock purchase agreement and sold shares of Freight Series A to The Public Investment Fund, whichis an investor in Uber.\nIn November 2021, Freight Holdin\ng entered into a series A-1 stock purchase agreement (\u201c2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) with outsideinvestors\n (\u201cFreight Series A-1 Investors\u201d) to sell shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock of Freight Holding (\u201cFreight Series A-1\u201d). Neither the FreightSeries A\n or Freight Series A-1 investments changed the conclusion that Freight Holding is a consolidated VIE. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we continue toown\n the  majority  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock  of  Freight  Holding  and  report  non-controlling  interest  as  further  described  in  Note  17  \u2013  Non-Controlling Interests.\nDivestiture of ATG Business and Aurora Investments\nIn\n April 2019, we contributed certain of our subsidiaries and certain assets and liabilities related to our autonomous vehicle technologies (excluding liabilitiesarising from\n certain indemnification obligations related to the Levandowski arbitration and any remediation costs associated with certain obligations that may ariseas a\n result of the Waymo settlement) to Apparate in exchange for common units representing 100% ownership interest in Apparate. Subsequent to the formation ofApparate,\n Apparate  entered  into  a  Class  A  Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  (\u201cPreferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement\u201d)  with  SVF  Yellow  (USA)  Corporation(\u201cSoftBank\u201d),\n Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (\u201cToyota\u201d), and DENSO International America, Inc. (\u201cDENSO\u201d). Preferred units were issued in July 2019 toSoftBank,\n Toyota, and DENSO and provided the investors with an aggregate 13.8% initial ownership interest in Apparate on an as-converted basis. The commonunits\n held  by  us  in  Apparate  were  determined  to  be  a  variable  interest.  The  purpose  of  Apparate  was  to  develop  and  commercialize  autonomous  vehicle  andridesharing\n technologies and Apparate\u2019s results were part of All Other (formerly our ATG and Other Technology Programs segment, refer to Note 14 - SegmentInformation and Geographic \nInformation for further information).130\n", "As of December 31, 2020, we consolidated the ATG Business\u2019 assets and liabilities and reported non-controlling interests. On January 19, 2021, we completedthe\n sale  of  the  ATG  Business  to  Aurora.  Refer  to  the  section  titled  \u201cUnconsolidated  VIEs\u201d  below  for  additional  information  on  Aurora.  Refer  to  Note  19  \u2013Divestitures for furthe\nr information on the sale of the ATG Business.Careem Qatar and Morocco\nOn\n January 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem and certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to an asset purchaseagreement\n (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d) in countries where regulatory approval was obtained or which did not require regulatory approval. The assets andoperations\n in  Qatar  and  Morocco  (collectively  \u201cNon-Transferred  Countries\u201d)  had  not  yet  been  transferred  to  us  as  of  December  31,  2020.  The  purpose  of  theCareem\n Qatar and Morocco\u2019s operations is to provide primarily ridesharing services in each respective country. Although the assets and operations of the Non-Transferred Countries were no\nt transferred as of December 31, 2020, we had rights to all residual interests in the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countrieswhich\n was considered a variable interest. We were exposed to losses and residual returns of the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries through theright\n to  all  of  the  proceeds  from  either  the  divestiture  or  the  eventual  legal  transfer  upon  regulatory  approval  of  the  entities  comprising  the  Non-TransferredCountries.\n We controlled Intellectual Properties (\u201cIP\u201d) which are significant for the business of Non-Transferred Countries and sub-license those IP to the Non-Transferred\n Countries. Each entity that comprised the Non-Transferred Countries met the definition of a VIE and we were the primary beneficiary of each of theentities comprising th\ne Non-Transferred Countries. As a result, we consolidated the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries as of December 31, 2020.On\n September 21, 2021, ownership of Careem\u2019s operations in Morocco was fully transferred to us. Transfer of the assets and operations of Careem Qatar willbe\n subject to a delayed closing pending timing of regulatory approval. We have rights to all residual interests in the Careem Qatar entity which is considered avariable\n interest. We are exposed to losses and residual returns of the Careem Qatar entity through the right to all of the proceeds from either the divestiture or theeventual legal trans\nfer, upon regulatory approval, of the Careem Qatar entity. As a result, we consolidated Careem Qatar as of December 31, 2021.Unconsolidated VIEs\nWe\n do not consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest but are not the primary beneficiary because we lack the power to direct the activities thatmost\n significantly  impact  the  entities\u2019  economic  performance.

On January 21, 2020, we acquired compulsorily convertible cumulativepreference shares (\u201cCCPS Preferred Shares\u201d) of Zomato valued at\n $171 million in exchange for Uber\u2019s food delivery operations in India (\u201cUber Eats India\u201d), and anote\n receivable valued at $35 million for reimbursement of goods and services tax. As of December 31, 2020, our investment in the CCPS Preferred Shares ofZomato represented\n 9.99% of the voting capital upon conversion to ordinary shares. Zomato was a VIE as it lacked sufficient equity to finance its activities withoutfuture\n subordinated  financial  support.  We  were  exposed  to  Zomato\u2019s  economic  risks  and rewards  through  our  investment  and note  receivable  which  representvariable\n interests, and the carrying values of these variable interests reflect our maximum exposure to loss. However, we were not the primary beneficiary becauseneither\n the investment in CCPS Preferred Shares nor the note receivable provide us with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Zomato\u2019seconomic performanc\ne. Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures for further information regarding Zomato and the divestiture of Uber Eats India.During\n the second quarter of 2021, the outstanding note receivable was paid.

Apparate, a subsidiary of ours, issued 1.0 million Preferred Units at $1,000 per unit to the Investors foran aggregate considera\ntion of $1.0 billion ($400 million from Toyota, $333 million from SoftBank, and $267 million from DENSO). As of December 31, 2020, thePreferred\n Units represented an aggregate 14.2% ownership interest in Apparate on an as-converted basis. As of December 31, 2020, we retained the remaining85.8% ownership interest. SoftBank and Toyot\na are our existing investors. At\n the option of the Investors, the Preferred Units are convertible into common units of Apparate, initially on a one-for-one basis but subject to potentialadjustment,\n as  defined  by  the  Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  at  any  time.  The  Preferred  Units  are  entitled  to  certain  distributions,  including  primarilydividends\n which are payable in cash or in-kind (at Apparate's discretion), and accrue quarterly, compounded on the last day of each quarter at a 4.5% annual rate.The Preferred Units are en\ntitled to distributions upon the occurrence of a sale or liquidation of Apparate representing an amount that is equal to the greater of (i) theoriginal investment\n plus any accrued but unpaid amounts, and (ii) their share of distributions assuming conversion to common units of Apparate immediately priorto\n the  sale  or  liquidation  event.  The  quarterly  dividend,  along  with  any  attributed  prorated  share  of  Apparate\u2019s  net  income  (if  applicable),  are  included  in  netincome\n (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations. The Preferred Units do not participate in net lossesdue to a liquidation pref\nerence.SoftBank\u2019s Preferred Units\nBeginning\n on July 2, 2026, SoftBank has the option to put to us all, but not less than all, of its initial investment in Preferred Units at a price equal to thenumber of SoftBank\u2019s Preferred Units multiplied by the greater of\n (i) the original investment plus any accrued but unpaid amounts per unit and (ii) the fair value ofthe\n Preferred Units at the time of conversion (the \u201cPut/Call Price\u201d). Beginning on July 2, 2026, we can call all, but not less than all, of the Preferred Units held bySoftBank\n at the Put/Call Price. We have the option to settle all, or a portion of, the Put/Call Price with its common stock and any remainder will be satisfied incash.\n The put and call were determined to be embedded features within the SoftBank Preferred Units since they are not separately exercisable or legally detachedfrom the SoftBank Preferred Uni\nts.As\n of December 31, 2020, the SoftBank Preferred Units were classified as redeemable non-controlling interests in our consolidated financial statements andreported\n at the Put/Call Price which was determined as of the balance sheet date. The initial fair value of SoftBank\u2019s Preferred Units was determined based on ahybrid\n method with the option pricing model as the primary methodology. This method used Level 3 fair value measurement inputs as well as an assumed equalprobability\n of the occurrence of a liquidation or exit event. The significant unobservable inputs used in the initial fair value measurement include: volatility of42%,\n time to liquidity of 5 years, and a discount for lack of marketability of 17%. A market approach was also used to corroborate the valuation derived from thehybrid\n method  at  issuance  to  evidence  that  the  issuance  price  of  the  Preferred  Units  approximated  their  fair  value.  There  was  no  fair  value  adjustment  toSoftBank\u2019s redeemable non-con\ntrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2020.Toyota and DENSO\u2019s Preferred Units\nAs of\n December 31, 2020, the Toyota and DENSO Preferred Units  were classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these units were not subjectto any mandatory redempt\nion rights or redemption rights that are outside our control. ATG Collaboration Agreement with Apparate, Toyota and DENSO\nIn\n conjunction  with  the  Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  discussed  above,  we  entered  into  a  three-year  joint  collaboration  agreement  among  Toyota,DENSO,\n and Apparate to develop next-generation self-driving technology (the \u201cATG Collaboration Agreement\u201d), which became effective as of the closing of thePreferred\n Unit  Purchase  Agreement  in  July  2019.  Pursuant  to  the  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement,  Toyota  would  make  cash  payments  to  Apparate  up  to  anaggregate\n of $300 million, payable in six semi-annual installments during the three-year term of the ATG Collaboration Agreement. The cash payments for eachsix-month\n period were  contingent  upon the  mutual  agreement  between the  parties  on the  development  activities  and milestones  to be achieved  in the next  sixmonths\n and  the  continuation  of  the  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement.  The  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement  was  within  the  scope  of  ASC  808,  CollaborativeArrangements.\n The development  activities  were considered  ongoing and central  to the activities  of ATG. As a result,  the amounts received  from Toyota wererecognized as collaboration revenue in the All other segment (formerly ATG and Other Technolo\ngy Programs) ratably over the respective six-month service periodto\n which each payment relates, as the related development activities are performed. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we recognized $42million and $100 million, r\nespectively, as revenue under the ATG Collaboration Agreement.Divestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\n133\n", "On January 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of our ATG Business to Aurora.

During 2019, we made an initial investment of $50 million (the \u201cInitial CornershopInvestment\u201d). The rem\naining investment was subject to antitrust approval of the countries where Cornershop operates.During\n the second quarter of 2020, we received regulatory approvals, except for Mexico. As a result, we and Cornershop amended the terms of the agreementin\n order for Uber to acquire Cornershop\u2019s business operations, except for those in Mexico. Immediately prior to the transaction close, Cornershop was restructuredsuch\n that the Mexico operations were held in Cornershop Technologies LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary (collectively referred to as \u201cCS-Mexico\u201d), while allof the remaining Cornershop ope\nrations were to be held in the newly created CS-Global entity.On July\n 6, 2020, we acquired 55% controlling interest in CS-Global, an entity which held all of Cornershop\u2019s business operations, except for those in Mexico.This\n transaction resulted in an Uber direct capital contribution of $200 million, which included the Initial Cornershop Investment and notes receivable, to CS-Global\n and a payment of $179 million to tendering shareholders, paid in a combination of cash and 2,055,038 shares of our common stock. The Initial CornershopInvestment\n was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber\u2019s pre-acquisition ownershippercentage,\n the new value was not materially  different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at theoriginal\n $50 million. In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-Global, representing 55% ofthe\n outstanding  membership  interests.  As  a  result,  we  obtained  the  controlling  financial  interest  in  CS-Global  and  accounted  for  the  acquisition  as  a  businesscombination. Concurrent with the CS-Global acquisition\n transaction, Uber, Cornershop and CS-Global entered into a put/call arrangement over the non-controllinginterest\n in CS-Global, providing CS-Global with the right through the call option (and obligation through the put option held by Cornershop) to purchase all of theinterests\n in CS-Mexico, contingent upon the receipt of regulatory approval in Mexico (\u201cCS-Mexico Put/Call\u201d). Upon either the exercise of the call option (by CS-Global)\n or the put option (by Cornershop), CS-Global would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests in CS-Mexico. Uber would make a direct capitalcontribution\n to CS-Global and a payment to the tendering shareholder, totaling $94 million, in exchange for 55% outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico. TheCS-Mexico\n Put/Call, which was exercisable in 5 years if there is no IPO or liquidation event, at a future negotiated price, was accounted for separately from theacquisition, and was included in o\nther current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.137\n", "The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for CS-Global was $362 million, which consisted of the following (in millions):Fair Value\nInitial Cornershop Investm\nent$ 50 Notes receivable\n10 Cash paid\n253 Tender offer paid in Uber co\nmmon stock67 Total consideration transferred\n380 Less: CS-Mexico Put/Call\n(18) Total consideration\n$ 362 The following table \nsummarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in millions):Fair Value\nCurrent assets\n$ 204 Goodwill\n384 Intangible assets\n122 Other long-term assets\n11 Total assets acquired\n721 Current liabilities\n(34) Deferred tax liability\n(33) Other long-term liabilities\n(2) Total liabilities assumed\n(69) Less: Redeemable non-contro\nlling interests(290) Net assets acquired\n$ 362 The\n excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable  intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill which is notdeductible\n for tax purposes.

We also allowed unvested RSUs for Uber stock held by144\n", "employees of the ATG Business that transferred to Aurora to continue to vest over the next 12 months contingent upon the employee remaining at Aurora. As aresult, we recognized li\nabilities of $315 million as consideration for these future obligations to Aurora.The\n sale of the ATG Business did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore doesnot\n qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation.

CONTROLS AND\n PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe\n maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that wefile\n or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeperiods\n specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,including our\n Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule13a-15(b)\n under  the  Exchange  Act,  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  ourdisclosure\n controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief ExecutiveOfficer\n and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that,  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  our  disclosure  controls  andprocedures are effective at a reas\nonable assurance level.Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to\n our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected,or are reasonably likely t\no materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur\n management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controlover financial repor\nting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, ourmanagement\n does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.Any control system,\n no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that itsobjectives\n will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all controlissues and instances of fraud, \nif any, within our company have been detected.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur\n management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under theExchange\n Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in\u201cInternal\n Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on thatassessment,\n our  management  has  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  December  31,  2021.  In  addition,PricewaterhouseCoopers\n LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting asof December 31, 2021. You can find the fu\nll text of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attestation report in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In\n accordance with guidance from the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control overfinancial reporting\n for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management\u2019s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded theinternal\n control activities of The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), which we acquired in October 2021 and Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d), which we acquired inNovember\n 2021, as discussed in Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We have included the financial results ofthese\n in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and total revenues related toDrizly\n and Transplace that were excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting collectively represented approximately 3% and 4% ofour consolidated total ass\nets and total revenues as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.ITEM 9B.

The amount of quarterly cash compensation that each Non-Employee\n Director will be entitled to receive for service as a director, committee chair, or committee member, as the case may be, will be equal to: (1) a fraction,(a)\n the  numerator  of  which  is  the  annual  cash  retainer  for  the  applicable  role,  and  (b)  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  number  of  days  in  the  calendar  year;multiplied\n by (2) the number of days the Non-Employee Director served as a director, committee member, or committee chair, as the case may be, during suchquarter.\nCompensation for service on any o\nther special or standing committees of the Board, will be determined from time to time by the Compensation Committee.Non-Employee Directors based\n in the United States may elect to convert the cash compensation described in this Policy into restricted stock unit awards (\u201cRSUs \u201d) in\n accordance  with  the  Uber  Technologies,  Inc.

The Policy was last amended on November 1, 2021, to be effective January 1, 2022.If\n an  individual  becomes  a  Non-Employee  Director  after  the  effective  date  of  the  Policy,  the  terms  of  the  Policy  then  in  effect  will  apply  to  such  individualcommencing on the date he o\nr she becomes a Non-Employee Director.3\n", "This Policy will be reviewed periodically and may be amended from time to time by the Compensation Committee.

Business.\nOur Mission\nImprove people\u2019s lives with \nthe world\u2019s best transportation.Overview\nLyft,\n Inc  (the  \u201cCompany\u201d  or  \u201cLyft\u201d)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.  In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demandridesharing\n and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.\nWe\n believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (\u201cTaaS\u201d). Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal\n change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the \u201cLyft App\u201d) in cities across the United States and in selectcities\n in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing\n our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to i\nmprove the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We\n are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the\u201cLyft\n Platform\u201d)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant\n number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We\u2019ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit \nfrom technological innovation in mobility.Today,\n our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (\u201cLight Vehicles\u201d)for\n shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fix\ned period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership.We\n generate substantially all of our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions fromdrivers\n for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue. We also generate revenue fromriders\n renting  Light  Vehicles,  drivers  renting  vehicles  through  Express  Drive,  Lyft  Rentals  renters,  Lyft  Driver  Center  and  Lyft  Auto  Care  users,  and  by  making  ourridesharing\n marketplace  available  to organizations  through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Corporate Business Travel programs.  In the secondquarter of 2021, we began genera\nting revenues from licensing and data access agreements, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies.We\n have  made  focused  and  substantial  investments  in  support  of  our  mission.  For  example,  to  continually  launch  new  innovations  on  our  platform,  we  haveinvested\n heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community,cultivate a diffe\nrentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerfulmultimodal platfor\nm and scaled user network.Notwithstanding\n the impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Wealso\n continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-drivingtechnology\n on the Lyft network. Our strategy is to always be at the forefront of transportation innovation, and we believe that through these investments, we will continueto be well positioned as a le\nader in TaaS. Even as we invest in the business, we also remain focused on finding ways to operate more efficiently.To advance our mission, we aim\n to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility.We\n believe  that  our  brand  represents  freedom  at  your  fingertips:  freedom  from  the  stresses  of  car  ownership  and  freedom  to  do  and  see  more.  Through  our  LyftUpinitiative,\n we\u2019re working to make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code. We arealso\n proud to be leaders in the fight against climate change. We\u2019ve made the commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles (\u201cEVs\u201d) on the Lyft network by the end of 2030.We believe many users a\nre loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility.Our\n values, brand and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services,including\n a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment. As we progress through the COVID-19 recovery, we remain confident the demand for ourofferings will continue to g\nrow as more and more people discover and rely on the convenience, experience and affordability of using Lyft.5\n", "Impact of COVID-19 to our BusinessThe\n ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  continues  to  impact  communities  in  the  United  States,  Canada  and  globally.  Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments\n and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions\n and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited\n the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform\n leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.\nAlthough\n we have seen some signs of demand improving, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of the pandemic, demand levels continue to beaffected by the\n impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. The extent to which our operations will continueto\n be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new informationwhich\n may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemicor\n recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has caused many businesses to delay employees returning tothe\n office,  which  in  turn  reduces  levels  of  demand.  Even  as  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders  are  modified  or  lifted,  we  anticipate  that  continued  socialdistancing, altered consu\nmer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration ofthese challenges cannot b\ne presently estimated.In\n response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing\n and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcountreductions in 2020.\nFor\n more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I.

Our  core offering since 2012 connects drivers with riders who need to get somewhere. The scale of our network enables us to predictdemand and\n proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for driversand offer\n convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in citiesacross the United States and in s\nelect cities in Canada.\u2022\nExpress Drive. Our  flexible car rentals program for drivers who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our requirements.Through\n our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the LyftPlatform.\n\u2022\nLyft Rentals. In  2019, we launched Lyft Rentals to offer an attractive option for users who have long-distance trips, such as a weekend away. This is a separateconsumer offering from Exp\nress Drive.\u2022\nLight Vehicles. We  have a network of shared bikes and scooters (\u201cLight Vehicles\u201d) in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for optionsthat\n are more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. These modes can also help supplement the first-mile andlast-mile of a multimodal trip \nwith public transit.\u2022\nPublic  Transit. Available  in  select  cities,  our  Transit  offering  integrates  third-party  public  transit  data  into  the  Lyft  App  to  offer  users  a  robust  view  oftransportation\n options around them and allows them to see transit routes to their destinations at no cost. Providing real-time public transit information is anotherstep toward providing effec\ntive, equitable and sustainable transportation to our communities, and creating a more seamless and connected transportation network.\u2022\nLyft Autonomous. We  have a number of strategic partnerships that offer access to autonomous vehicles. Our Open Platform partnership with Motional (formerlyAptiv)\n has enabled the commercial  deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles on our platform in Las Vegas. In July 2021, we completed a multi-elementtransaction\n with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicle division, Level 5,as\n well  as  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyft  rideshare  and  fleet  data  to  accelerate  the  safety  and  commercialization  of  the  automated-drivingvehicles\n that Woven Planet is developing. In December 2021, we launched an autonomous rideshare service in Miami with Ford and Argo AI, delivering on ashared commitment to d\neploy Ford\u2019s autonomous vehicles, powered by the Argo Self-Driving System, on our ridesharing network.We have established one of \nthe largest transportation networks in the United States and Canada. While network scale is important, we recognize that transportationhappens locally and each m\narket has its own unique user network. Our dynamic platform adjusts to the specific attributes of each market on a real-time basis.Drivers\nThe\n drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between. We workhard\n to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to be their own bosses and providing them the opportunity to focus their time on what mattersmost. Key benefits to drivers on ou\nr platform include:\u2022\nFlexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives.\u2022\nTechnology. Our  predictive  technology  around  ride  volume  and  demand  enables  us  to  share  key  information  with  drivers  about  when  and  where  to  drive  tomaximize their earnings on a\n real-time basis.\u2022\nInsurance. We  procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (\u201cTNC\u201d) drivers against financial losses related to automobile accidents whileon the platform.\n\u2022\nCommunity Standards. To help us uphold high  community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride booked throughthe Lyft App.\n\u2022\nSupport. Our  Driver  Hubs  and  certain  field  locations  in  major  cities  serve  as  gathering  places  and  offer  in-person  support  and  a  personal  connection  to  Lyftemployees. In addition, driv\ners have access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals.Riders\nRiders are\n as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and from work,explore\n their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated, riders are passengers whorequest\n rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experienceevery time they open the Ly\nft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation network of choice. Key benefits to riders on our platform include:7\n", "\u2022Selection and Convenience. We  designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently matchesriders\n with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability. Additional modes, such asLight\n Vehicles,  offer  riders  more  options  for  shorter  trips.  The  more  rides  that  are  taken  on  our  platform,  the  better  we  are  able  to  offer  riders  personalizedexperiences most suitab\nle to the trip being planned.\u2022\nAvailability. We  strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data to help drivers and ridersconnect efficient\nly and reduce wait times.\u2022\nAffordability. Our platform empowers ride rs to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time.\u2022\nSafety. Since day one, we have worked continuousl y to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative products, policiesand processes.\nBusiness\nLyft\n is evolving how businesses large and small take care of their people\u2019s transportation needs across sectors including corporate, healthcare, auto, education andgovernment.\n Our  comprehensive  set  of  solutions  allows  clients  to  design,  manage  and  pay  for  ground  transportation  programs  that  contribute  to  productivity  andsatisfaction while redu\ncing cost, improving transparency and streamlining operations.Our Technology Infrastructure and Operations\nWe\n organize our product teams with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science and design. We focuson\n affordability,  reliability,  efficiency,  optimization  and  cohesion  when  developing  our  software.  Our  offerings  are  mobile-first  and  platform  agnostic.  We  seek  tocontinuously improve the Lyft Pl\natform and the Lyft App. Our offerings are built on a scalable technology platform that enables us to manage peaks in demand.We have a commercial agreement with Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) for cloud services to help deliver and ho\nst our platform. As a result of our partnership, webelieve\n we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. Our commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect untilterminated\n by  AWS  or  us.  AWS  may  only  terminate  the  agreement  for  convenience  after  January  31,  2026,  and  only  after  complying  with  certain  advance  noticerequirements.\n AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or for failure to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providingprior\n written notice and a 30-day cure period. Under this agreement, we committed to spend an aggregate of at least $300 million between January 2019 and June 2022 onAWS\n services, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the three years. In February 2022, we amended the agreement and committed to spend an aggregate of atleast\n $350  million  between  February  2022  and  January  2026,  with  a  minimum  of  $80  million  in  each  of  the  four  years.  If  we  fail  to  meet  the  minimum  purchasecommitment\n during any year, we may be required to pay the difference. We pay AWS monthly, and we may pay more than the minimum purchase commitment to AWSbased on usage.\nWe\n designed  our  platform  with  multiple  layers  of  redundancy  to  guard  against  data  loss  and  deliver  high  availability.  Both  incremental  and  full  backups  areperformed\n and redundant copies of content are stored independently in separate geographic regions. We are also investing in iterating and continuously improving our dataprivacy and security founda\ntion, and continually review and implement the most relevant policies.Our Proprietary Data-Driven Technology Platform\nOur robust technology platform powers the millions of\n rides and connections that we facilitate every day and provides insights that drive our platform in real-time.We\n leverage historical data to continuously improve experiences for drivers and riders on our platform. Our platform analyzes large datasets covering the ride lifecycle,from when drivers go online and r\niders request rides, to when they match, which route to take and any feedback given after the rides. Utilizing machine learning capabilitiesto\n predict  future  behavior  based  on many  years  of historical  data  and use cases,  we employ  various  levers  to balance  supply and demand  in  the  marketplace,  creatingincreased driver ea\nrnings while maintaining strong service levels for riders. We also leverage our data science and algorithms to inform our product development.Our Intellectual Property\nWe\n believe  that  our  intellectual  property  rights  are  valuable  and  important  to  our  business.  We  rely  on  trademarks,  patents,  copyrights,  trade  secrets,  licenseagreements,\n intellectual  property  assignment  agreements,  confidentiality  procedures,  non-disclosure  agreements  and  employee  non-disclosure  and  invention  assignmentagreements to\n establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills andingenuity of our employees and \nthe functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and offerings are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.8\n", "We have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in ridesharing, autonomous vehicle-relatedtechnology,\n telecommunications, networking and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31, 2021, we held 343 issued U.S. patents and had 310 U.S.patent\n applications pending. We also held 70 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions and had 143 applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review ourdevelopment efforts to \nassess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.We have an ongoing trademark\n and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in theUnited\n States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some trademarks. In addition, we haveregistered domain nam\nes for websites that we use in our business, such as www.lyft.com and other variations.We\n intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect ourintellectual\n property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.

Our key growth strategies include our plans to:\u2022\nIncrease Rider Use Cases. We  are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offerproducts to\n simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services anduniversity\n safe rides programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizationsto manage the transport\nation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.\u2022\nGrow Active Riders. We  see opportunities to continue to recoup and grow our rider base amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. We may make incrementalinvestments in our\n brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We may also offer discounts for first-time ridersto\n try Lyft or provide incentives to existing riders to encourage increased ride frequency. We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace byattracting\n and retaining more drivers on our network to deliver the best possible service levels. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand ournetwork\n coverage  beyond  the  geographies  and  markets  we  currently  serve.  We  also  believe  we  are  a  beneficiary  of  demographic  shifts,  such  as  the  growingpercentage of the U.S. population \nthat is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.\u2022\nGrow Our Share of Consumers\u2019 Transportation Spend. Lyft\u2019s  transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft networkspans\n rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit and vehicle services. By integrating the fragmented transportation ecosystem, we are well positioned to deliverthe best holistic exper\nience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity.\u2022\nDeliver  Increasing  Value  to  Drivers. We  strive  to  provide  drivers  that  use  Lyft  with  the  best  possible  experience,  including  access  to  the  best  economicopportunities. For example, throu\ngh our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We\u2019ve also been investing in ourDriver\n Centers,  Mobile  Services  and  related  partnerships  that  offer  drivers  affordable  and  convenient  vehicle  maintenance  services.  By  making  the  driverexperience better \nand better, we can retain and attract more drivers to Lyft\u2019s network.\u2022\nInvest in our Marketplace Technology. Our  investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers andriders.\n Our investments in mapping, routing, payments, in-app navigation, matching technologies and data science are key to making our network more efficientand seamless to use.\n\u2022\nThoughtfully Pursue M&A and Strategic Partnerships. In November 2018, we acquired Bikeshar e Holdings LLC (\u201cMotivate\u201d), the largest bike sharing platform inthe\n United States at the time and in February 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, LLC (\u201cFlexdrive\u201d), one of our longstanding Express Drive partners. We will continueto\n selectively  consider  acquisitions  that  contribute  to the  growth of our  current  business,  help  us expand  into  adjacent  markets  or  add new capabilities  to ournetwork.\n We believe drivers and riders will continue to benefit from a broad partner ecosystem that builds on our existing loyalty and reward programs. We havealso\n built strong relationships with transportation suppliers, state and local governments, and technology solutions providers and we intend to continue to pursuepartnerships that contr\nibute to our growth.Competition\nThe\n market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of newservices and offerings. W\ne expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new9\n", "entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to thesecompetitive\n challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnationthat could adversely af\nfect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n main ridesharing competitors in the United States and Canada include Uber and Via. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market includeLime\n and Bird. Our main competitors in the consumer vehicle rental market include Enterprise, Hertz and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share marketplaces.We also compete with ce\nrtain non-ridesharing transportation network companies and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers.Additionally,\n there  are  other  non-U.S.-based  TaaS  network  companies,  non-ridesharing  transportation  network  companies  and  traditional  automotivemanufacturers that may expand into the United States and Cana\nda, such as BMW, which has an ongoing presence in the transportation network market in Europe. There arealso\n a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Apple,Aurora,\n Baidu and General Motors (Cruise) as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We anticipate continued challengesfrom current compet\nitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.We\n believe we can compete favorably. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longeroperating\n histories,  larger  marketing  budgets  and  established  marketing  relationships,  access  to  larger  customer  bases  and  significantly  greater  resources  for  thedevelopment\n of their offerings. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related toOperational\n Factors\u2014We  face  intense  competition  and  could  lose  market  share  to  our  competitors,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  andresults of operations.\u201d\nSeasonality\nThe revenue we generate f\nrom our business may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors including the weather and certain holidays. We expect thedemand\n for our transportation network may decline over the winter season and the demand for our network of Light Vehicles may increase during more temperate and dryseasons.\n Our business is also subject to risks related to COVID-19. In particular, travel bans and mobility restrictions have weighed on demand. Although we have seensome\n signs of demand improving as COVID-19 conditions have improved, particularly compared to the start of the pandemic, the exact timing and pace of the recoveryremain\n uncertain. We are unable to predict when and to what extent these public health and safety measures may be eased, how riders will respond to the easing of suchmeasures,\n as well as whether additional measures may need to be implemented in the future, any of which may continue to result in decreased demand notwithstandingusual seasonality.\nOur Brand and Marketing\nWe\n believe good energy moves the world. The Lyft brand is rooted in our hospitality principles: safety, simplicity, reliability, care, and delight. Our marketingefforts\n bring our brand to life across a variety of communication channels ranging from national broadcast campaigns to more direct communications like email and socialmedia engagement. We \nalso benefit from positive word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider communityOur\n marketing efforts educate people about Lyft products in creative and memorable ways and generate greater brand awareness among potential drivers andriders.\n Our brand marketing includes but is not limited to Lyft-produced content, culture and entertainment partnerships, marketing partnerships, sponsored local events,and outdoor advertisements.\nWe\n use specific channels and initiatives so we can measure the impact of our marketing spend. We attract new drivers and riders through referrals, partnerships,display advertising,\n radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization, keyword search campaigns, and more. We continue to engage with current riders througha variety of initia\ntives, including emails, in-app notifications, social media content, promotions, and more.Our Commitment to Safety\nA\n strong guiding principle since day one has been to build a community that drivers and riders trust. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with drivers andriders on our platform, and we \ntake significant measures every day that are focused on their safety.To ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding hig\nh quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or SCC (formerlyknown\n as Customer Experience and Trust), team as a key part of our organization. With over 300 employees as of December 31, 2021, SCC is in charge of fielding safetyand\n customer support inquiries and is available through multiple channels, including via self-service and assisted support directly within our apps. Our SCC team focuseson driving results based on exper\nience-based metrics including First Contact Resolution, which is the number of support tickets resolved during first contact with a driver orrider, and\n Net Promoter Score. SCC aims to eliminate bad customer experiences, quickly resolve problems when they occur and maintain trust with drivers and riders. Thisdedication\n led  our  customer  support  to  be  recently  named  number  one  in  Newsweek\u2019s  2021  America\u2019s  Best  Customer  Service  rankings  for  the  Taxi  and  Ridesharingcategory.\n10\n", "Some measures we take to promote the safety of riders and drivers on the platform include:\u2022\nAnnual background checks. Every driver is required to pass a professionally administered background check before they drive and each year after that.\u2022\nOngoing  criminal  monitoring.  Continuous  criminal  monitoring  allows  us  to  quickly  deactivate  drivers  with  disqualifying  criminal  convictions.  We  also  checkdriving records throughout the y\near to promptly identify and remove disqualified drivers from the platform as soon as a violation is detected.\u2022\nMandatory safety education.  Drivers must complete a safety program developed with RAINN, the largest anti-sexual violence organization in North America.These\n programs  can  vary  by  state  and  cover  topics  such  as  how  to  create  a  safe  and  comfortable  ride,  appropriate  conversation  topics,  respecting  personalboundaries, and recognizing and \nreporting sexual assault and sexual misconduct.\u2022\nEmergency help, supported by ADT. If  a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly connect with anADT security professional.\n\u2022\nHidden contact information and ride history. The  Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride. While ridersand drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, incl\nuding real user phone numbers, are not revealed. Drivers are also not ableto see a rider\u2019s drop-of\nf location, whether it\u2019s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.\u2022\nTwo-way ratings and mandatory feedback. At  the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider ordriver\n who submits  a rating  of four  stars or fewer  is prompted  to provide  more details.  Anyone who rates  a rider  or driver  three  stars  or fewer  will never  bematched with that individu\nal again through the app.In 2021,\n we published our Community Safety Report, which is available on our website and details the frequency of some of the most serious safety incidents thatare reported to us, which ar\ne statistically very rare. From 2017 to 2019, over 99% of trips occurred without any reported safety incident, which accounted for 0.0002% of alltrips\n in this period. However, while safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we recognize that behind every report is a real person and real experience, and ourgoal is to make each Lyft \nride as safe as we possibly can.Government Regulation\nWe\n are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such asTNCs,\n public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentialityobligations,\n product  liability,  defects,  recalls,  auto  maintenance  and  repairs,  personal  injury,  text  messaging,  subscription  services,  intellectual  property,  securities,consumer\n protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions,terms\n of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medicaltransportation,\n healthcare  fraud,  waste,  and  abuse,  environmental  health  and  safety,  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  background  checks,  public  health,  anti-corruption,  anti-bribery,\n political contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls anddelivery\n of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in manycases\n due  to  their  lack  of  specificity.  As  a  result,  their  application  in  practice  may  change  or  develop  over  time  through  judicial  decisions  or  as  new  guidance  orinterpretations ar\ne provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.The\n TNC industry has also come under increasing scrutiny from non-profit organizations, regulators, and legislators for its environmental impact, specificallyincreasing\n greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions.  In  2018,  California  passed  first-of-its-kind  legislation  (the  \u201cCalifornia  Clean  Miles  Standard  and  Incentive  Program\u201d)  tomandate\n that TNCs reduce their GHG emissions on a GHG per passenger-mile basis, with additional requirements that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emissionvehicles\n on  their  platforms.  Policymakers  recently  proposed  analogous  legislation  in  Washington  and  Oregon.  Other  states  are  actively  observing  the  California  CleanMiles Standard and Incentiv\ne Program as well.See\n the sections titled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d including the subsections titled \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors\u2014Challenges to contractorclassification\n of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business,\u201d \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related toRegulatory\n and Legal Factors\u2014Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws andregulations could\n harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations,\u201d \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Operational Factors\u2014We rely on third-party paymentprocessors\n to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such third parties and otherpayment-related\n risks,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  be  adversely  affected,\u201d  \u201cRisk  Factors\u2014Risks  Related  to  Regulatory  and  LegalFactors\u2014Changes in laws\n or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to complywith such laws and regulations or any o\nther obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could11\n", "adversely affect our business\u201d, \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors\u2014We face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messagessent\n in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors\u2014Climate change may have a long-termimpact on our business\u201d for add\nitional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.Human Capital\nOur\n employees  are  our  human  capital  and  they  are  our  greatest  strength  and  most  valuable  resource.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  4,453  employees  inapproximately\n 119 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks. Approximately 40% of our employees work in our productmanagement, engineer\ning, design and science organizations. Our employees are passionate about our mission to improve people\u2019s lives with the world\u2019s best transportation.We\n believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more ouremployees\n reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2021, our employee base was 59%male\n and 39% female, and women represented 37% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 44% White, 30% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latinx,8%\n Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity information is basedon\n self-identification,  and  employees  who  did  not  disclose  their  gender  or  ethnicity  have  been  excluded  from  the  applicable  disclosure.  As  of  December  31,  2021,employees\n who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 2% oftotal U.S. employees.\nWe\n strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, developtalent\n internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We launched initiatives such as requiring all director level and above roles to consider at least one woman andone\n Black  or  Latinx  candidate  at  the  onsite  interview  stage.  We  are  continuing  to  focus  on  scaling  and  sustaining  diverse  partnerships  and  early  candidate  pipelinedevelopment as we believe \nrecruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization.One of\n the most powerful examples of Lyft\u2019s devotion to inclusivity is our ongoing commitment to pay fairness. We conducted an annual pay equity audit for ourfifth consecutive yea\nr to assess for any systemic issues in our compensation. We worked with third party experts to conduct statistical tests on a majority of U.S. based teammembers\u2019\n annual  salary,  equity  awards,  and  total  compensation  at  hire.  The  goal  was  to  identify  whether  any  statistically  significant  pay  differences  existed  betweendifferent\n demographic (gender and race) groups in the same band, level and job family. Where our analysis identified differences, we investigated, including looking atfactors\n not accounted for in the statistical models we used. In 2021, we did not find patterns of statistically significant pay differences for different gender or racial groupsafter accounting for legitimate b\nusiness factors like performance, experience, and location.Given continued uncertainty \nand as we recognize our remote work policy must be broadened, we have given many employees the option to work from home.None of our employees are rep\nresented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.In\n December 2020, we released our 2020 Inclusion, Diversity and Racial Equity Report, which is available on our website. We have presented this report since2017 and intend to continue to pres\nent this report to make available certain information about our diversity and inclusion efforts.Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance\nIn\n May 2021, we released our 2021 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Report, which is available on our website. We began publishing this reportin 2020 and intend to continue to pr\nepare this report annually to make available key information about our work toward environmental, social, and economic issues.Environmental\nLyft\n was founded on the belief that technology will enable us to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from the transportation system. Our vision is to rebuildcities\n around people by offering seamless access through the Lyft App to on-demand rides, public transit, and car rentals as well as lower-carbon micromobility modes. Asanother\n step in the shift from personal car ownership, we\u2019ve also launched Lyft Pink, our premier membership program, which offers discounted pricing for rideshare,bikes, and scooters, in addition \nto perks for car rentals.We\n launched our national Resilient Streets Initiative in September 2020 and offered a vision for how cities can safely and efficiently move the greatest number ofpeople\n as economic, educational and social activities resume in our cities. The initiative reimagined what a \u201cresilient street corridor\u201d might look like in cities where Lyftoperates\n micromobility  services.  It  also  investigated  the  impact  of  street  design  on  key  metrics  around  vehicle  miles  traveled,  socioeconomic  demographics  and  GHGemissions.\n12\n", "Because we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft made the commitment to reach 100% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030.By\n working with drivers to transition to EVs, we have the potential to avoid tens of millions of metric tons of GHG emissions to the atmosphere and to reduce gasolineconsumption\n by  more  than  a  billion  gallons  over  the  next  decade.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Clean  Miles  Standard  and  Incentive  Program  which  was  approved  by  theCalifornia\n Air Resources Board in May 2021 and sets the target that ninety percent of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. The shift to 100%EVs\n will mean transitioning all vehicles used on the Lyft platform over the next decade to all-electric or other zero-emission technologies. This includes cars in ExpressDrive, Lyft Rentals, Lyft Autonomous, and pe\nrsonal cars used by drivers on the Lyft platform. Switching to EVs is not just good for the planet; it\u2019s good for people \u2013 riders,drivers, and the communit\nies they serve.Social\nWe\n approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust,respect\n and a common objective of improving people\u2019s lives by improving transportation. Through our LyftUp initiative, we\u2019re working to enable access to affordable,reliable\n transportation for all \u2014 no matter income or zip code. We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most seriousoutstanding\n transportation gaps. Through our LyftUp programs, we partner with leading organizations, including government agencies and nonprofits, to provide access tofree and discounted car, b\nike and scooter rides to individuals and families in need. LyftUp programs included:\u2022\nJobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job;\u2022\nGrocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for families living in certain areas without sufficient grocery store access;\u2022\nCommunity Grants Program - awards ride credits to hyp erlocal nonprofit organizations across the country making a difference in their communities;\u2022\nMicromobility  Access -  provides  deeply  discounted  bikeshare  and  scooter-share  memberships  for  eligible  applicants  who  qualify  for  federal,  state  or  localassistance programs;\n\u2022\nUniversal Vaccine Access Campaign -  mobilizes a coalition of partners to provide rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for low-income, underinsuredand at-risk communities;\n\u2022\nDisaster Response - provides rides to access v ital services both leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies when roads are safe to do so;and\n\u2022\nVoting Access - provides rides to the polls du ring Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such asseniors, veterans and commun\nities of color.In\n response to the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8 (\u201cSB8\u201d) which raised concerns that drivers could be sued simply for transporting passengers, Lyft created aDriver\n Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. We also donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood tohelp ensure\n that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. Drivers using Lyft are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Similarly, ridersshould never have to justify or sh\nare where they are going or why.Corporate Governance\nOur\n board of directors regularly evaluates our corporate governance structure and processes to help steer the company's direction and ensure it is operating withthe\n utmost business integrity. More information about our directors, executive officers and corporate governance will be included in our definitive Proxy Statement for our2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nCorporate Information\nWe\n were incorporated in 2007 as Bounder Web, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In 2008, we changed our name to Zimride, Inc. We founded Lyft in 2012 andchanged our name to Lyft, Inc. \nin 2013 when we sold the assets related to our Zimride operations.13\n", "Available InformationOur\n website is located at www.lyft.com, and our investor relations website is located at investor.lyft.com.

business, financial condition and results of operations. Weare\n unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related effects will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operationsand the achievement of our strategic obj\nectives.Our\n business, operations and financial performance have been negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, suchas\n travel bans, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. The pandemic and these related responses continue to evolve and have caused, and are expected to continue tocause,\n decreased  demand  for  our  platform  relative  to  pre-COVID-19  demand,  disruptions  in  global  supply  chains,  and  significant  volatility  and  disruption  of  financialmarkets.\nThe\n COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, thosediscussed below:\n\u2022\nDeclines in travel as a result of COVID-19, including commuting, local travel, and business and leisure travel, have resulted in decreased demand for our platformwhich\n has decreased our revenues. These factors have in the past and may continue to lead to a decrease in earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Wepaused our\n shared rides offerings as a result of COVID-19, but relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021. While certain typesof\n travel  have  begun  to  increase  compared  to  earlier  periods  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  overall  levels  remain  depressed  and  changes  in  travel  trends  andbehavior\n arising from COVID-19, including as a result of new strains of COVID-19, may continue to develop or persist over time and further contribute to thisadverse effect.\n\u2022\nChanges in driver behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to reduced levels of driver availability on our platform relative to rider demand in certainmarkets.\n This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability is limited, our service levels have been and may be negativelyimpacted\n and we have increased prices or provided additional incentives and may need to continue to do so, which may adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of oper\nation.\u2022\nThe responsive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to modify our business practices by permitting corporate employees in nearly all of ourlocations\n to  work  remotely,  limiting  employee  travel,  and  canceling,  postponing  or  holding  virtual  events  and  meetings.  We  may  be  required  to  or  choosevoluntarily\n to take additional actions for the health and safety of our workforce and users of our platform, including after the pandemic subsides and with respectto\n vaccination, whether in response to government orders or based on our own determinations of what is in the best interests of our employees or users of ourplatform.\n The effects of the pandemic, including permanent hybrid and remote working arrangements for employees, may also impact our real estate footprint,financial reporting\n systems and internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and may increase the risk of a cybersecurity breach or incident. Tothe\n extent these measures result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture, adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our financialstatements or maint\nain internal controls, or otherwise negatively affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\u2022\nWe design and contract to manufacture Light Vehicles using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of LightVehicles\n that meet our standards is critical to our operations. We also design and contract to manufacture certain assets related to our network of shared LightVehicles\n and we rely on a small number of suppliers for components and manufacturing services. We have faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemicrelated\n to  these  assets,  such  as  delays  in  their  manufacture  and  delivery  and  increased  costs  associated  with  manufacturing  and  shipping,  and  we  may  faceadditional\n challenges  in future periods. These challenges may adversely  affect our ability  to deploy new Light Vehicles on our network or to implement  newfeatures\n on our network of Light Vehicles. These supply chain issues have and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.\n\u2022\nThe impacts of COVID-19 have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the demand for vehicles rented to drivers through our Express Drive program,and\n for the fleet rented to users through Lyft Rentals. Further, COVID-19 has and may continue to negatively impact Lyft\u2019s ability to conduct rental operationsthrough\n the Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals as a result of restrictions on travel, mandated closures, limited staffing availability, and other factors relatedto\n COVID-19. For example, in 2020, Lyft Rentals temporarily ceased operations, closing its rental locations, as a result of COVID-19. Further, while ExpressDrive\n rental periods renew on a weekly basis, new rental reservations were temporarily blocked in 2020, and subsequently re-opened with modified operations tolimit\n the proximity and amount of interactions between associates and drivers, and to address additional cleaning which may be required as a result of COVID-19.These\n operations are more costly, and vulnerable to shortages of cleaning supplies or other materials required to operate rental sites while minimizing the risk ofexposure\n to COVID-19. As a result of the adverse impact to demand for rides on the rideshare platform, drivers renting through the Express Drive program havehad\n and may continue to have a diminished ability to pay their rental fees. In response, in 2020, Flexdrive temporarily reduced pricing for Flexdrive rentals incities\n most affected by COVID-19, which has since been reversed. In 2020, Flexdrive also began to waive rental fees for drivers who are confirmed to have testedpositive\n for COVID-19 or requested to quarantine by a medical professional, which it continues to do at this time. Further, Lyft Rentals and Flexdrive have facedsignificantly higher cos\nts in transporting, repossessing, cleaning, and17\n", "storing unrented and returned vehicles. These impacts to the demand for and operations of the different rental programs have and may continue to adversely affectour business, financial condi\ntion and results of operation.\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may delay or prevent us, or our current or prospective partners and suppliers, from being able to test, develop or deploy autonomousvehicle-related\n technology,  including  through  direct  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  virus  on  employee  and  contractor  health;  reduced  consumer  demand  forautonomous vehicle\n travel resulting from an overall reduced demand for travel; shelter-in-place orders by local, state or federal governments negatively impactingoperations,\n including our ability to test autonomous vehicle-related technology; impacts to the supply chains of our current or prospective partners and suppliers;or\n economic  impacts  limiting  our  or  our  current  or  prospective  partners\u2019  or  suppliers\u2019  ability  to  expend  resources  on  developing  and  deploying  autonomousvehicle-related\n technology.  These  impacts  to  the  development  and  deployment  of  autonomous  vehicle-related  technology  may  adversely  affect  our  business,financial condition and \nresults of operations.\u2022\nIn response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we have had to take certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs, furloughs and salaryreductions, which\n may have adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees. As the severity, magnitude and durationof\n the COVID-19 pandemic, the public health responses, and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic\u2019simpact\n on our operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives, remainsuncertain\n and difficult to predict. As the pandemic continues, the recovery of the economy and our business have fluctuated and varied by geography. Further, theultimate\n impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our users, customers, employees, business, operations and financial performance depends on many factors that arenot\n within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to thepandemic\n (including restrictions on travel and transport and modified workplace activities); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response thereto onlocal\n or  regional  economies,  travel  and  economic  activity;  the  speed  and  efficacy  of  vaccine  distribution;  the  availability  of  government  funding  programs;evolving\n laws and regulations regarding COVID-19, including those related to disclosure, notification and pricing; general economic uncertainty in key marketsand financial market volatility;\n volatility in our stock price, global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; the duration of the pandemic; the extent ofany virus mutations or new stra\nins of COVID-19; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.\u2022\nIn light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financialand operating results.\nOur business could be adversely affected by natural d\nisasters, public health crises, political crises, economic downturns or other unexpected events.A significant\n natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, mobile networks, theInternet\n or the operations of our third-party technology providers. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known forseismic\n activity and increasingly for fires. The impact of climate change may increase these risks. In addition, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,other\n epidemics, political  crises, such as terrorist  attacks, war and other political  or social instability and other geopolitical  developments, or other catastrophic  events,whether\n in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole. For example, we have offices and employees in Belarus andUkraine\n that are expected to be adversely affected by the current conflict in the region. The impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or ourthird-party\n providers\u2019 abilities could result in decreased demand for our offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.A deterioration of general macroeconomi\nc conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and\n results of operations are also subject to global economic conditions, including any resulting effect on spending by us or riders. A deterioration ofgeneral\n macroeconomic  conditions,  including  slower  growth  or  recession,  inflation,  changes  to  fuel  and  other  energy  costs  or  vehicle  costs,  or  decreases  in  consumerspending\n power or confidence may harm our results of operations. Economic  weakness or uncertainty, and constrained consumer spending have in the past resulted in, andmay\n in the future result in, decreased revenues and earnings. Such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negativelyaffect\n our ability to make decisions about future investments. In addition, economic instability or uncertainty, and other events beyond our control, such as the COVID-19pandemic,\n have,  and  may  continue  to,  put  pressure  on  economic  conditions,  which  has  led  and  could  lead,  to  reduced  demand  for  services  on  our  platform  or  greateroperating\n expenses. For  example,  inflation  has  broadly  impacted  the  auto  service  industry,  which  has  increased  our  insurance  costs.  If  general  economic  conditionsdeteriorate\n in  the  United  States  or  in  other  markets  where  we  operate,  discretionary  spending  may  decline  and  demand  for  ridesharing  may  be  reduced.  An  economicdownturn resulting in a prolonged r\necessionary period may have a further adverse effect on our revenue.18\n", "Risks Related to Operational FactorsOur limited operating history and our evolving business make \nit difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.While\n we have primarily focused on ridesharing since our ridesharing marketplace launched in 2012, our business continues to evolve. We regularly expand ourplatform\n features, offerings and services and change our pricing methodologies. In recent periods, we have also reevaluated and changed our cost structure and focused ourbusiness\n model. Our evolving business, industry and markets make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks andchallenges we have faced o\nr expect to face include our ability to:\u2022\nforecast our revenue and budget for and manage our expenses;\u2022\nattract new qualified drivers and new riders and retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders in a cost-effective manner;\u2022\ncomply with existing and new or modified laws and regulations applicable to our business;\u2022\nmanage our platform and our business assets and expenses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures issued by various jurisdictions,including\n travel  bans,  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders,  as  well  as  maintain  demand  for  and  confidence  in  the  safety  of  our  platform  during  andfollowing the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nplan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future offerings, including our network of Light Vehicles or certain vehicles in the Express Driveprogram and the fleet o\nf vehicles for Lyft Rentals, and manage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to our current and future offerings;\u2022\ndevelop, manufacture, source, deploy, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of Light Vehicles, Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, MobileServices, Lyft Auto Care, cert\nain vehicles in the Express Drive program, vehicles for Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle technology;\u2022\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\u2022\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\u2022\neffectively manage our growth and business operations, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business;\u2022\nsuccessfully expand our geographic reach;\u2022\nhire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;\u2022\nsuccessfully develop new platform features, offerings and services to enhance the experience of users; and\u2022\nright-size our real estate portfolio.If\n we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this\u201cRisk\n Factors\u201d section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have an evolving financial model andoperate\n in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a static financial model oroperated\n in  a  more  predictable  market.  We  have  encountered  in  the  past,  and  will  encounter  in  the  future,  risks  and  uncertainties  frequently  experienced  by  growingcompanies\n with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate ourbusiness,\n are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations could be adversely affected.Our financial performance in recent periods may not b\ne indicative of future performance, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Prior\n to COVID-19, we grew rapidly. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and the related government and public health measures, our revenue declined significantly andwe\n have since recovered partially, but our revenue remains below pre-COVID levels and the timeline for a full recovery is uncertain. Accordingly, our recent revenuegrowth\n rate and financial performance, including prior to the effects of COVID-19, the decline related to COVID-19 and recent growth rates compared to periods in themidst\n of the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, although we have achieved Adjusted EBITDA profitability ineach\n of the last three quarters, we have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we can provide no assurances that we will achieve or maintain AdjustedEBITDA profitability in the futu\nre, on a quarterly or annual basis, or that we will ever achieve profitability on a GAAP basis.19\n", "Our expenses will likely increase in the future as we develop and launch new offerings and platform features, expand in existing and new markets and continue toinvest\n in  our  platform  and  customer  engagement,  or  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  These  efforts  may  be  more  costly  than  we  expect  and  may  not  result  inincreased\n revenue  or  growth  in  our  business.  For  example,  we  have  incurred  and  will  continue  to  incur  additional  costs  and  expenses  associated  with  the  passage  ofProposition 22 in California including provi\nding drivers in California with new earnings opportunities and protections, including contributions towards healthcare coverage,occupational\n accident insurance and minimum guaranteed earnings, and we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with theCOVID-19\n pandemic, including sales, marketing and costs relating to our efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we have expanded overtime\n to include  more  asset-intensive  offerings  such as our network of Light  Vehicles,  Flexdrive,  Lyft  Rentals and Lyft  Auto Care.  We are  also  expanding the  supportavailable\n to drivers at our Driver Hubs, our driver-centric service centers and community spaces, Driver Centers, our vehicle service centers, Mobile Services, Lyft AutoCare,\n and  through  our Express  Drive  vehicle  rental  program.  In addition,  we have  established  environmental  programs,  such  as our commitment  to 100% EVs  on ourplatform\n by the end of 2030. These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation,asset\n life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, ourinvestments\n may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition to the above, a determination in, or settlement of, anylegal proceeding that classifies a\n driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations (includingpotentially\n suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow ourbusiness,\n which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Additionally,\n stock-based  compensation  expense  related  to  restricted  stock  units  (\u201cRSUs\u201d)  and  other  equity  awards  may  continue  to  be  a  significant  expense  in  futureperiods,\n and as of December 31, 2021, we had $587.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, that will berecognized\n over  a  weighted-average  period  of  approximately  1.7  years.  Any  failure  to  increase  our  revenue  sufficiently  to  keep  pace  with  our  investments  and  otherexpenses\n could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks andchallenges as we encounter \nthem, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.As\n our business recovers from the effects of COVID-19 and we endeavor to return to pre-COVID financial performance, our revenue growth rates and results ofoperations\n will fluctuate due to a number of reasons, which may include long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, slowing demand for our offerings,increasing competit\nion, a decrease in the growth of our overall market or market saturation, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and resulting changes to our businessmodel\n and our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incursignificant losses in the \nfuture and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.We face intense competit\nion and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The\n market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of newservices\n and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greaterresources\n or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive positioncould weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or gro\nwth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and resultsof operations.\nOur main ridesharing competitors in the United States and Cana\nda include Uber and Via. Our main competitors in bike and scooter sharing include Lime and Bird.Our\n main competitors in consumer vehicle rentals include Enterprise, Hertz and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share marketplaces. We also compete withcertain non-rideshar\ning transportation network companies and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers.Additionally,\n there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, bike and scooter sharing companies, consumer vehicle rental companies, non-ridesharingtransportation\n network companies and traditional  automotive manufacturers  that may expand into the United States and Canada, such as BMW, which has an ongoingpresence in the transpor\ntation network market in Europe. There are also a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology that may compete with us in thefuture,\n including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Apple, Aurora, Baidu and General Motors (Cruise) as well as many other technology companies and automobilemanufacturers and suppli\ners. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.Certain\n of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, research and development, manufacturing and other resources,greater\n name recognition, longer operating histories or a larger user base than we do. They may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and saleof\n offerings and offer lower prices than we do, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, they may have greater resources to deploy towards theresearch, development\n and commercialization of new technologies, including autonomous vehicle technology or Light Vehicles, or they may have other financial, technicalor resource advantages. Thes\ne factors may allow our competitors or potential competitors to derive greater revenue and20\n", "profits from their existing user bases, attract and retain qualified drivers and riders at lower costs or respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and trends.Our\n current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative or strategic relationships, or consolidate, amongst themselves or with third parties that may furtherenhance their resourc\nes and offerings.We believe that our ab\nility to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\u2022\nthe popularity, utility, ease of use, performance and reliability of our offerings compared to those of our competitors;\u2022\nour reputation, including the perceived safety of our platform, and brand strength relative to our competitors;\u2022\nour pricing models and the prices of our offerings and the fees we charge drivers on our platform;\u2022\nour ability, and our ability compared to our competitors, to manage our business and operations during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recovery as well asin\n response  to  related  governmental,  business  and  individuals\u2019  actions  that  continue  to  evolve  (including  restrictions  on  travel  and  transport  and  modifiedworkplace activities);\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders;\u2022\nour ability, and our ability compared to our competitors, to develop new offerings;\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain relationships with partners;\u2022\nour ability to develop, manufacture, source, deploy, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of Light Vehicles, Driver Hubs, DriverCenters,\n Mobile Services, Lyft Auto Care, certain vehicles in the Express Drive program, vehicles for Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle technology, includingthe success of any strateg\nic options we may consider with regard to our assets;\u2022\nchanges mandated by, or that we elect to make, to address legislation, regulatory authorities or litigation, including settlements, judgments, injunctions and consentdecrees, including those r\nelated to the classification of drivers on our platform;\u2022\nour ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees;\u2022\nour ability to raise additional capital as needed; and\u2022\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry.If we are unable to compe\nte successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our results of operations vary and are unpredictable from per\niod-to-period, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.Our results\n of operations have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that our results of operations will continue to do so for a variety of reasons,many\n of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, theresults\n of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have presented many of the factors that may cause our results of operationsto\n fluctuate in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections, or theexpectations of analysts o\nr investors, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.The ridesharing market and the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehic\nles, are still in relatively early stages of growth and development andif\n such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large or otherwise develop as we expect, our business, financial conditionand results of operations could be adversely af\nfected.Prior\n to COVID-19, the ridesharing market grew rapidly, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow,particularly\n after the COVID-19 pandemic, if at all. In addition, the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, is new and unproven, and it isuncertain\n whether demand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on thewillingness\n of people to widely adopt ridesharing and our other offerings. We cannot be certain whether the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact thewillingness\n of drivers or riders to participate in ridesharing or the willingness of riders to use shared bikes or scooters. In addition, we paused our shared rides offerings(though\n we relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021), and we were temporarily restricted from operating our bike share and scootershare\n programs in one jurisdiction due to public health and safety measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently temporarily suspendedrentals\n of scooters due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. Although the scooter rental suspension was lifted in February 2021, in the event of a resurgence ofCOVID-19, we may be required or believe \nit is advisable to suspend such offerings again. If the public21\n", "does not perceive ridesharing or our other offerings as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding public health or safety, affordability or forother\n reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors\u2019 platforms, the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, then the market for our offeringsmay\n not further develop, may develop more slowly than we expect or may not achieve the growth potential we expect. Additionally, from time to time we may re-evaluatethe\n markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certainmarkets as a result of su\nch evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If\n we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business, financial condition andresults of operations could be harmed.\nOur\n continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and toincrease\n utilization  of  our  platform  by  existing  drivers.  To  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers,  we  have,  among  other  things,  offered  sign-up  and  referral  bonuses  andprovided\n access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. If we do not continue to provide drivers withflexibility on our plat\nform, compelling opportunities to earn income and other incentive programs, such as volume-based discounts and performance-based bonuses, that arecomparable or\n superior to those of our competitors and other companies in the app-based work industry, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits orour\n requirements for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilizationof\n our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example,during\n the pandemic, we have periodically had a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets particularly where restrictions on social activitiesand\n visiting business venues were or have been eased. This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offerincreased\n incentives to improve supply, our revenue may be negatively impacted. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have beenable\n to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. Our competitors may attempt to compete for drivers on the basis of these earning opportunities, ordrivers\n may determine that such earning opportunities are not sufficient. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increaseour\n expenses.  Notwithstanding  the  passage  of  Proposition  22,  ongoing  litigation  seeking  to  reclassify  drivers  as  employees  is  pending  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  Thisincludes\n a  lawsuit  seeking  to  overturn  Proposition  22  in  California,  where  a  lower-court  judge  issued  an  order  on  August  20,  2021  finding  that  Proposition  22  isunenforceable (which order is now on appeal \nwith Proposition 22 remaining in effect during the appeal). If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we maybe\n required  to  classify  drivers  as  employees  rather  than  independent  contractors  in  those  jurisdictions.  If  this  occurs,  we  may  need  to  develop  and  implement  anemployment\n model that we have not historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions. We may face specific risksrelating\n to our ability to onboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employeedrivers to meet rider demand.\nIf\n drivers  are  unsatisfied  with  our  partners,  including  our  third-party  vehicle  rental  partners,  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers  who  satisfy  ourscreening criteria\n and procedures and to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers could be adversely affected. Further, incentives we provide to attract driverscould\n fail to attract and retain qualified drivers or fail to increase utilization by existing drivers, or could have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changesin\n certain laws and regulations, including immigration,  labor and employment laws or background check requirements, may result in a shift or decrease in the pool ofqualified\n drivers, which may result in increased competition for qualified drivers or higher costs of recruitment, operation and retention. As part of our business operationsor\n research and development efforts, data on the vehicle may be collected and drivers may be uncomfortable or unwilling to drive knowing that data is being collected.Other\n factors outside of our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other concerns about personal health and safety, increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles orinsurance, or concerns about\n the availability of government or other assistance programs if drivers continue to drive on our platform, may also reduce the number of driverson\n our platform or utilization of our platform by drivers, or impact our ability to onboard new drivers. If we fail to attract qualified drivers on favorable terms, fail toincrease utiliza\ntion of our platform by existing drivers or lose qualified drivers to our competitors, we may not be able to meet the demand of riders, including maintaining acompetitive price o\nf rides to riders, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If\n we fail to cost-effectively attract new riders, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing riders, our business, financial condition and results of operationscould be harmed.\nOur\n success depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract new riders, retain existing riders and increase utilization of our platform by current riders.Riders\n have a wide variety of options for transportation, including personal vehicles, rental cars, taxis, public transit and other ridesharing and bike and scooter sharingofferings.\n Rider  preferences  may  also  change  from  time  to  time.  To  expand  our  rider  base,  we  must  appeal  to  new  riders  who  have  historically  used  other  forms  oftransportation\n or other ridesharing or bike and scooter sharing platforms. We believe that our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of ourofferings,\n which  in  turn  drives  new  rider  growth  and  rider  utilization.  However,  our  reputation,  brand  and  ability  to  build  trust  with  existing  and  new  riders  may  beadversely\n affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our offerings, our policies, including our pricing algorithms, drivers on our platform, or our competitors,even if factually in\ncorrect or based on isolated incidents. Further,22\n", "if existing and new riders do not perceive the transportation services provided by drivers on our platform to be reliable, safe and affordable, or if we fail to offer new andrelevant\n offerings and features on our platform, we may not be able to attract or retain riders or to increase their utilization of our platform. As we continue to expand intonew\n geographic areas, we will be relying in part on referrals from our existing riders to attract new riders, and therefore we must ensure that our existing riders remainsatisfied\n with our offerings. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience seasonality in both ridesharing and Light Vehicle rentals during the wintermonths,\n which may harm our ability to attract and retain riders during such periods. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased and may continue to affect utilizationof\n our platform by riders, including longer term. If we fail to continue to grow our rider base, retain existing riders or increase the overall utilization of our platform byexisting\n riders,  we may not be able to provide drivers with an adequate level  of ride requests, and our business, financial  condition and results  of operations  could beadversely\n affected. In addition, if we do not achieve sufficient utilization of our asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Rentals vehicles,our business, financial condi\ntion and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\n rely substantially on our wholly-owned subsidiary and deductibles to insure auto-related risks and on third-party insurance policies to insure and reinsure ouroperations-related\n risks. If our insurance or reinsurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet theirobligations, we may not be able to mit\nigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.From the\n time a driver becomes available to accept rides in the Lyft Driver App until the driver logs off and is no longer available to accept rides, we, through ourwholly-owned\n insurance  subsidiary  and  deductibles,  often  bear  substantial  financial  risk  with  respect  to  auto-related  incidents,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  andunderinsured\n motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certainlimits.\n To comply with certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related risks, we procure a number of third-party insurancepolicies\n which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions. In all U.S. states, our insurance subsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change from time to time, ofthe auto-related r\nisk from some third-party insurance providers. In connection with our reinsurance and deductible arrangements, we deposit funds into trust accounts with athird-party\n financial institution from which some third-party insurance providers are reimbursed for claims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as ofDecember\n 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. If we fail to comply with state insurance regulatory requirements or otherregulations\n governing  insurance  coverage,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  be  adversely  affected.  If  any  of  our  third-party  insuranceproviders\n or administrators who handle the claim on behalf of the third-party insurance providers become insolvent, they could be unable to pay any operations-relatedclaims that we make.\nWe\n also procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including employment practices liability, workers\u2019 compensation, businessinterruptions,\n cybersecurity  and  data  breaches,  crime,  directors\u2019  and  officers\u2019  liability  and  general  business  liabilities,  including  product  liability.  For  certain  types  ofoperations-related\n risks or future risks related to our new and evolving offerings, such as a scaled network of autonomous vehicles, we may not be able to, or may choosenot\n to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolvingofferings, and\n we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our insurance or reinsuranceproviders\n becomes insolvent, it could be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. Certain losses may be excluded from insurance coverage including, butnot limited to losses caus\ned by intentional act, pollution, contamination, virus, bacteria, terrorism, war and civil unrest.The\n amount of one or more auto-related claims or operations-related claims has exceeded and could continue to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits,for\n which we have borne and could continue to bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured retentions or otherwisepaid\n by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many types of claims, coverages and for a variety of commercial risks andare\n likely to do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when ourpolicies\n are renewed or replaced to manage pricing pressure. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) cost per claim,premiums\n or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providersfail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not pr\novided, (v) the number of claims and average claim cost under our deductibles orself-insured retent\nions differs from historic averages or (vi) an insurance policy is cancelled or non-renewed.Our actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adv\nersely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We\n establish  insurance  reserves  for  claims  incurred  but  not  yet  paid  and  claims  incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  related  estimable  expenses,  and  weperiodically\n evaluate  and, as necessary,  adjust our actuarial  assumptions  and insurance  reserves  as our experience  develops or new information  is learned.  We employvarious\n predictive  modeling  and  actuarial  techniques  and  make  numerous  assumptions  based  on  limited  historical  experience  and  industry  statistics  to  estimate  ourinsurance\n reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective and speculative.While\n an independent actuary firm periodically reviews our reserves for appropriateness and provides claims reserve valuations, a number of external factors can affect theactual\n losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open, fluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatorydevelopments, judicial d\nevelopments and unexpected23\n", "events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Such factors can impact the reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate thereserves\n for claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. Additionally, we have encountered in the past, andmay\n encounter in the future, instances of insurance fraud, which could increase our actual insurance-related costs. For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses forclaims\n and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the aggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements. If we determinethat\n our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination, which could result in an increase to ournet\n loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the adverse development toinsurance\n reserves we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2021 was largely attributable to historical auto losses that are associated with accident liabilities between 2018and 2020.\nWe\n rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers for our auto-related insurance claims, and if such providers fail to service insurance claims toour expectations or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financia\nl condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We rely on a\n limited number of third-party insurance service providers to service our auto-related claims. If any of our third-party insurance service providers failsto\n service claims to our expectations, discontinues or increases the cost of coverage or changes the terms of such coverage in a manner not favorable to drivers or to us, wecannot\n guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage or services on reasonable terms in an acceptable time frame or at all. If we cannot find alternatethird-party insurance s\nervice providers on terms acceptable to us, we may incur additional expenses related to servicing such auto-related claims using internal resources.We\n may, from time to time, explore the possibility of selling portions of retained insurance risk to third-parties. This may cause us to incur additional expenses inthe\n total  cost  of  this  risk.  For  example,  in  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2020,  we  entered  into  a  Novation  Agreement  to  transfer  nearly  all  of  our  primary  auto  insuranceliabilities\n related  to  periods  preceding  October  2018  to  a  third-party,  in  October  2020,  we  expanded  our  rideshare  insurance  program  to  include  additional  third-partyinsurance-service\n providers,  and  in  April  2021,  we  executed  an  agreement  to  reinsure  our  captive  insurance  entity  for  $183  million  of  coverage  above  the  insuranceliabilities\n recorded as of March 31, 2021 for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020. We are subject to recapture of the risk if ourthird party reinsurer we\nre to default on their reinsurance obligation.Any\n negative publicity related to any of our third-party insurance service providers could adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead toincreased regulatory o\nr litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n reputation, brand and the network effects among the drivers and riders on our platform are important to our success, and if we are not able to maintain andcontinue developing our reputation, brand and network effects, our business, financial \ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\n believe that building a strong reputation and brand as a safe, reliable and affordable platform and continuing to increase the strength of the network effectsamong the\n drivers and riders on our platform are critical to our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders. The successful development of our reputation, brandand\n network effects will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Negative perception of our platform or company may harm our reputation,brand and networks effects, in\ncluding as a result of:\u2022\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, drivers on our platform, riders, our product offerings, pricing or our policies and guidelines, including our practices andpolicies with respect to d\nrivers, or the ridesharing industry, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents;\u2022\nillegal, negligent, reckless or otherwise inappropriate behavior by drivers or riders or third parties;\u2022\na failure to provide drivers with a sufficient level of ride requests, charge drivers competitive fees and commissions or provide drivers with competitive fares andincentives;\n\u2022\na failure to offer riders competitive ride pricing and pick-up times;\u2022\na failure to provide a range of ride types sought by riders;\u2022\nconcerns by riders or drivers about the safety of ridesharing and our platform;\u2022\nactual or perceived disruptions of or defects in our platform, such as privacy or data security breaches or incidents, site outages, payment disruptions or otherincidents that impact the reliabilit\ny of our offerings;\u2022\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform or our business;\u2022\nusers\u2019 lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;24\n", "\u2022changes to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear or inconsistent with our values or mission or that are not clearly articulated;\u2022\na failure to detect a defect in our Lyft Autonomous technology or our Light Vehicles;\u2022\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair and transparent;\u2022\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our stated values and mission;\u2022\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support service experiences;\u2022\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\u2022\nnegative responses by drivers or riders to new offerings on our platform;\u2022\naccidents, defects or other negative incidents involving autonomous vehicles or Light Vehicles on our platform;\u2022\nperception of our treatment of employees and our response to employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\u2022\nmodification or discontinuation of our community or sustainability programs;\u2022\npolitical or social policies or activities; or\u2022\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects the public\u2019s perception of us or our industry as awhole.\nIf\n we do not successfully maintain and develop our brand, reputation and network effects and successfully differentiate our offerings from competitive offerings,our\n business may not grow, we may not be able to compete effectively and we could lose existing qualified drivers or existing riders or fail to attract new qualified driversor\n new riders, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes we may make to enhance and improveour\n offerings and balance the needs and interests of the drivers and riders on our platform may be viewed positively from one group\u2019s perspective (such as riders) butnegatively from another\u2019s perspective\n (such as drivers), or may not be viewed positively by either drivers or riders. If we fail to balance the interests of drivers and riders ormake\n changes that they view negatively, drivers and riders may stop using our platform, take fewer rides or use alternative platforms, any of which could adversely affectour reputation, brand, business, f\ninancial condition and results of operations.Illegal, improper\n or otherwise inappropriate activity of users, whether or not occurring while utilizing our platform, could expose us to liability and harm our business,brand, financial condition and results of operations.\nIllegal,\n improper or otherwise inappropriate activities by users, including the activities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not thenreceiving\n or providing services offered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating users of our platform could adversely affect our brand,business,\n financial condition and results of operations. These activities may include assault, theft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing ofrider or driver accoun\nts and other misconduct. While we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify and address the risk of these types of activities,these\n measures  may  not  adequately  address,  and  are  unlikely  to  prevent,  all  illegal,  improper  or  otherwise  inappropriate  activity  by  these  parties  from  occurring  inconnection\n with our offerings. Such conduct could expose us to liability or adversely affect our brand or reputation. At the same time, if the measures we have taken toguard against these\n illegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all drivers undergo annual background checks or our two-way ratingsystem and related poli\ncies, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent qualified drivers and riders otherwise in good standing from using our offerings, or if we are unableto\n implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, the growth and retention of the number of qualified driversand riders\n on our platform and their utilization of our platform could be negatively impacted. Further, any negative publicity related to the foregoing, whether such incidentoccurred\n on  our  platform,  on  our  competitors\u2019  platforms,  or  on  any  ridesharing  platform,  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation  and  brand  or  public  perception  of  theridesharing industry as a whole, whic\nh could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of theforegoing risks could harm our bus\niness, financial condition and results of operations.We\n rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential and existing drivers, and if such providers fail to provide accurate information, or if providersare\n unable  to  complete  background  checks  because  of  data  access  restrictions,  court  closures  or  other  unforeseen  government  shutdown,  or  we  do  not  maintainbusiness relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of opera\ntions could be adversely affected.We\n rely on third-party background check providers to screen the records of potential and existing drivers to help identify those that are not qualified to utilize ourplatform pursuant to appl\nicable law or our internal standards. Our business has been and may25\n", "continue to be adversely affected to the extent we cannot attract or retain qualified drivers as a result of such providers being unable to complete certain background checksbecause\n of  data  access  restrictions,  court  closures  or  other  government  shutdowns  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  or  to  the  extent  that  they  do  not  meet  theircontractual\n obligations,  our  expectations  or  the  requirements  of  applicable  law  or  regulations.  If  any  of  our  third-party  background  check  providers  terminates  itsrelationship\n with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to securesimilar\n terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we maynot\n be able to timely onboard potential drivers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers. Further, if the background checks conducted by ourthird-party\n background check providers do not meet our expectations or the requirements under applicable laws and regulations, unqualified drivers may be permitted toprovide rides on our platfor\nm, and as a result, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.We are\n also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing drivers on our platform. If we or drivers on ourplatform fail to co\nmply with applicable laws, rules and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Any\n negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to safety incidents or data security breaches orincidences,\n could adversely  affect  our reputation  and brand,  and could  potentially  lead to increased  regulatory  or litigation  exposure.  Any of the  foregoing  risks  couldadversely affect our bus\niness, financial condition and results of operations.Changes to our pricing could adversely affect our abil\nity to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.Demand\n for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven, incentives paid to drivers and the fees we charge drivers.Many factors,\n including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors\u2019 pricing and marketing strategies includingincreased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect\n our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader rangeof\n offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. Thisincludes\n the use of pricing algorithms to set dynamic prices depending on the route, time of day and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we havemade\n pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, throughcompetition,\n regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge thedrivers\n on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. Furthermore,the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders\n on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to competeeffectively\n in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local lawsand\n regulations  regarding  pricing  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  otherwise  have  imposed  limits  on  prices  for  certain  services  and  certain  local  regulationsregarding\n minimum earnings standards for drivers have caused us to revise our pricing methodology in certain markets, including New York City and Seattle. We havetested\n or launched, and expect to in the future test or launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as subscription packages and driver or rider loyalty programs. Wehave also modified,\n and expect to in the future modify, existing pricing methodologies, such as our up-front pricing policy. Any of the foregoing actions may not ultimatelybe successful in attra\ncting and retaining qualified drivers and riders or may result in negative public perception and harm to our reputation.While\n we continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in legal and administrative proceedings, our arguments may ultimately beunsuccessful. A\n determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver utilizing a ridesharingplatform\n as  an  employee,  may  require  us  to  revise  our  pricing  methodologies  to  account  for  such  a  change  to  driver  classification.  The  passage  of  Proposition  22  inCalifornia has enabled us to provide additional earning opp\nortunities to drivers in California, including guaranteed earnings. The transition has, and will continue to, requireadditional\n costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to this new model, including changes to our pricing. We have also tested or launched, andmay in\n the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for drivers on our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retainingqualified\n drivers.  Moreover,  successful  litigation  to  overturn  Proposition  22, or  the  reclassification  of  drivers  on  our platform  as employees  could  reduce  the  availablesupply\n of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices andbalance\n supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we couldbe underpricing\n or overpricing our offerings. In addition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. As we continue tolaunch\n new  and  develop  existing  asset-intensive  offerings  such  as  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles,  Driver  Hubs,  Driver  Centers  and  Mobile  Services,  Lyft  Auto  Care,Express\n Drive program and Lyft Rentals, factors such as maintenance, debt service, depreciation, asset life, supply chain efficiency and asset replacement may affect ourpricing\n methodologies. In addition, we have established environmental programs, such as our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may alsoaffect our pricing. Any such\n26\n", "changes to our pricing methodologies or our ability to efficiently price our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If\n we are unable to efficiently grow and further develop our network of Light Vehicles, which may not grow as we expect or become profitable over time, and managethe related risks, our business, financial condition and results of op\nerations could be adversely affected.While\n some major cities have widely adopted bike and scooter sharing, there can be no assurance that new markets we enter will accept, or existing markets willcontinue\n to accept, bike and scooter sharing, and even if they do, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our related offerings will be successful insuch\n markets. For example, in 2021, in New York City, a competing operator named Joco attempted to launch a bike share program in violation of Citi Bike\u2019s exclusivity,arguing\n that New York City could not regulate Joco because Joco\u2019s stations were in private garages. The City successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against Joco,with our support. However, Joco\n continues to operate in a limited manner and it is possible Lyft may need to further support the City in additional legal action against Joco.A\n negative  determination  in other legal  disputes regarding  bike and scooter  sharing, including  an adverse  determination  regarding  our existing  rights to operate,  couldadversely\n affect our competitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted fromoperating\n due to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. For example, the City of Miami suspendedrentals\n of  bikes  and  scooters  from  March  through  October  2020  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  and  again  suspended  rentals  of  scooters  from  December  2020through February 2021 an\nd for a brief period in November 2021 due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. While we do not expect any denial or suspension in anindividual\n region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we are ableto\n successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent service offering. In particular, there couldbe\n negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving anincreased\n number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and scooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidentson our platform or inciden\nts involving our competitors\u2019 offerings.We design and\n contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of bikesand\n scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be no assurance we will beable\n to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable basis, at a reasonable price or at all. Wealso\n design  and  contract  to  manufacture  certain  assets  related  to  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles  and  we  rely  on  a  small  number  of  suppliers  for  components  andmanufacturing services.\nThe\n supply chain for our bikes and scooters exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or shortages. In the event that our supply of bikes andscooters or\n key components is interrupted or there are significant increases in prices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Changes in business conditio\nns, force majeure, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental or regulatory changes and other factors beyond ourcontrol have affect\ned and could continue to affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver products and our ability to deploy products to the market on a timely basis.We incur significant costs related to the design, purchase, sourcing an\nd operations of our network of Light Vehicles and we expect to continue incurring such costsas\n we expand our network of Light Vehicles. The prices and availability of bikes and scooters and related products may fluctuate depending on factors beyond our controlincluding\n market and economic conditions, tariffs, changes to import or export regulations and demand. Substantial increases in prices of these assets or the cost of ouroperations\n would increase our costs and reduce our margins, which could adversely affect our business, financial  condition and results of operations. Further, customsauthorities\n may challenge or disagree with our classification, valuation or country of origin determinations of our imports. Such challenges could result in tariff liabilities,including tariffs\n on past imports, as well as penalties and interest. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible tariff liabilities in our financial statements,if these liabilit\nies exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.Our\n bikes  and  scooters  or  components  thereof,  including  bikes  and  scooters  and  components  that  we  design  and  contract  to  manufacture  using  third-partysuppliers,\n have  experienced  and  may  in  the  future  experience  quality  problems,  product  issues  or  acts  of  vandalism  or  theft  from  time  to  time,  which  could  result  indecreased\n usage of our network of Light Vehicles or loss of our bikes or scooters. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all product issues, vandalismor\n theft of our Light Vehicles. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, litigation or regulatory challenges, including personal injury or products liability claims, andharm to our reputation.\nThe revenue we generate from our network of Light Vehicles may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to, among other thing\ns, seasonal factors including weather.Our\n limited operating history makes it difficult for us to assess the exact nature or extent of the effects of seasonality on our network of Light Vehicles, however, wegenerally experience a decline in demand for our bike and scooter rentals over the winter seaso\nn and an increase during more temperate and dry seasons. Additionally, fromtime to time we may r\ne-evaluate the markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we have discontinued and27\n", "may in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as a result of such evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations.If\n we are unable to efficiently develop, enable, or implement partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platforms in a timelymanner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be advers\nely affected.We\n partner with several companies to develop autonomous vehicle technology and offerings. Autonomous driving is a new and evolving market, which makes itdifficult\n to  predict  its  acceptance,  its  growth,  and  the  magnitude  and  timing  of  necessary  investments  and  other  trends,  including  when  it  may  be  more  broadly  orcommercially\n available.  Our  initiatives  may  not  perform  as  expected,  which  would  reduce  the  return  on  our  investments  in  this  area  and  our  partners  may  decide  toterminate\n or  scale  back  their  partnerships  with  us.  In  addition,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  did,  and  may  in  the  future,  adversely  delay  or  prevent  us,  or  our  current  orprospective partners and supp\nliers, from being able to develop or deploy autonomous vehicle technology. Following the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division, weno\n longer develop our own autonomous vehicle technology, so we must develop and maintain partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technologyon\n our platforms, and if we are unable to do so, or if we do so at a slower pace or at a higher cost or if our technology is less capable relative to our competitors, or if ourefforts\n to  optimize  our  strategy  with  regard  to  our  autonomous  vehicle  technology  development  are  not  successful,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations could be adverse\nly affected.The\n autonomous vehicle industry may not continue to develop, or autonomous vehicles may not be adopted by the market, which could adversely affect our prospects,business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe\n have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in the development of autonomous vehicle-related technology for use on our platform. Autonomous drivinginvolves\n a complex set of technologies, including the continued development of sensing, computing and control technology. We have relied both on our own research anddevelopment\n and on strategic partnerships with third-party developers of such technologies, as such technologies are costly and in varying stages of maturity. There is noassurance\n that this research and development or these partnerships will result in the development of market-viable technologies or commercial success in a timely manneror\n at all and as a result of the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division, we are more reliant on partnerships for this development. In order to gain acceptance, thereliability of autono\nmous vehicle technology must continue to advance.Additional challenges to th\ne development and deployment of autonomous vehicle technology, all of which are outside of our control, include:\u2022\nmarket acceptance of autonomous vehicles;\u2022\nstate, federal or municipal licensing requirements, safety standards, and other regulatory measures;\u2022\nnecessary changes to infrastructure to enable adoption;\u2022\nconcerns regarding electronic security and privacy; and\u2022\npublic perception regarding the safety of autonomous vehicles for drivers, riders, pedestrians and other vehicles on the road.There\n are  a  number  of  existing  laws,  regulations  and  standards  that  may  apply  to  autonomous  vehicle  technology,  including  vehicle  standards  that  were  notoriginally\n intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly evolve, which may increase the likelihood of complex,conflicting\n or otherwise inconsistent regulations, which may delay our ability to bring autonomous vehicle technology to market or significantly increase the compliancecosts\n associated with this business strategy. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market will accept autonomous vehicles or the timing of such acceptance, if atall, and even if it does, that we will be able to execute on our busine\nss strategy or that our offerings will be successful in the market. Even if autonomous vehicle technologyis\n successfully developed and implemented, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent technology and its adopters. In particular, there could be negativepublic\n perception  surrounding  autonomous  vehicles,  including  the  overall  safety  and  the  potential  for  injuries  or  death  occurring  as  a  result  of  accidents  involvingautonomous\n vehicles  and  the  potential  loss  of  income  to  human  drivers  resulting  from  widespread  market  adoption  of  autonomous  vehicles.  Such  negative  publicperception\n may result from incidents on our platform, incidents on our partners\u2019 or competitors\u2019 platforms, or events around autonomous vehicles more generally. Any ofthe foregoing risks and chal\nlenges could adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.Claims\n from riders, drivers or third parties that are harmed, whether or not our platform is in use, could adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition andresults of operations.\nWe\n are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations and other legal proceedings relating to injuries to, or deaths of, riders, drivers or third-parties that areattributed\n to us through our offerings. We may also be subject to claims alleging that we are directly or vicariously liable for the acts of the drivers on our platform or forharm\n related to the actions of drivers, riders, or third parties, or the management and safety of our platform and our assets, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemicand related public hea\nlth measures issued by various jurisdictions, including travel bans, restrictions, social distancing guidance, and shelter-in-place28\n", "orders. We may also be subject to personal injury claims whether or not such injury actually occurred as a result of activity on our platform. For example, third parties havein\n the past asserted legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries related to the actions of a driver or rider who may have previously utilized our platform, butwas\n not at the time of such injury. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we sometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency,protection\n of our reputation and to prevent the uncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we faceincreasing\n public scrutiny. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any riders, drivers or third parties could result in negativepublicity\n and  harm  to  our  brand,  reputation,  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  Our  insurance  policies  and  programs  may  not  provide  sufficientcoverage\n to adequately mitigate the potential liability we face, especially where any one incident, or a group of incidents, could cause disproportionate harm, and we mayhave to pay high premiums or dedu\nctibles for our coverage and, for certain situations, we may not be able to secure coverage at all.As\n we expand our network of Light Vehicles, we are subject to an increasing number of claims, lawsuits, investigations  or other legal proceedings related toinjuries to, or deaths of, r\niders of our Light Vehicles, including potential indemnification claims. In some cases, we could be required to indemnify governmental entities forclaims arising out of issu\nes, including issues that may be outside of our control, such as the condition of the public right of way. Any such claims arising from the use of ourLight\n Vehicles, regardless of merit or outcome, could lead to negative publicity, harm to our reputation and brand, significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure ordecreased\n use of our Light Vehicles. Further, the bikes and scooters we design and contract to manufacture using third-party suppliers and manufacturers, including certainassets\n and components we design and have manufactured for us, have in the past contained and could in the future contain design or manufacturing product issues, whichcould\n also lead to injuries or death to riders. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all product issues, and failure to do so could harm ourreputation\n and brand or result in personal injury or products liability claims or regulatory proceedings. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations.Our\n bikes and scooters have experienced product issues from time to time, which has in the past resulted in, and, in the future may result in, product recalls andremoval\n from  service,  injuries, litigation,  enforcement  actions  and regulatory  proceedings, and could adversely  affect  our business, brand, financial  condition  andresults of operations.\nWe\n design, contract to design and manufacture, and directly and indirectly modify, maintain and repair, bikes and scooters for our network of Light Vehicles.Such\n bikes and scooters have in the past contained, and, in the future may contain, product issues related to their design, materials or construction, may be improperlymaintained\n or repaired or may be subject to vandalism. These product issues, improper maintenance or repair or vandalism have in the past unexpectedly interfered, andcould\n in the future unexpectedly interfere, with the intended operations of the bikes or scooters, and have resulted, and could in the future result, in other safety concerns,including\n alleged injuries to riders or third parties. Although we, our contract manufacturers, and our third-party service providers test our bikes and scooters before theyare deployed onto our network, the\nre can be no assurance we will be able to detect or prevent all product issues.Failure\n to detect, prevent, fix or timely report real or perceived product issues and vandalism, or to properly maintain or repair our bikes and scooters has resultedor\n may  result  in  a  variety  of  consequences  including  product  recalls  and  removal  from  service,  service  interruptions,  alleged  injuries,  litigation,  enforcement  actions,including fines or penalt\nies, regulatory proceedings, and negative publicity. Even if injuries to riders or third parties are not the result of any product issues in, vandalism of,or the failure to prope\nrly maintain or repair our bikes or scooters, we may incur expenses to defend or settle any claims or respond to regulatory inquiries, and our brand andreputation\n may be harmed. Any of the foregoing risks could also result in decreased usage of our network of Light Vehicles and adversely affect our business, brand,financial conditions and \nresults of operations.If we fail to effecti\nvely manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Since 2012\n and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we generally experienced rapid growth in our business, the number of users on our platform and our geographicreach, and we expect to cont\ninue to experience growth in the future following the recovery of the world economy from the pandemic. This growth placed, and may continueto\n place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Employee growth has occurred both at our San Francisco headquartersand in a number of our\n offices across the United States and internationally. The number of our full-time employees increased from 2,708 as of December 31, 2017, to 4,453as\n of December 31, 2021. However, from time to time, we have undertaken restructuring actions to better align our financial model and our business. For example, in thesecond\n quarter of 2020, we implemented a plan of termination to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic challenges resultingfrom\n the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, which plan involved the termination of approximately 17% of our employees. Steps we take to manage ourbusiness operations, includin\ng remote work policies for employees, and to align our operations with our strategies for future growth may adversely affect our reputation andbrand, our ability to rec\nruit, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel.Our ability to manage\n our growth and business operations effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business willrequire\n us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage employees. Continued growthcould\n strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train and retainhighly skilled personnel and m\naintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the29\n", "quality of our offerings could suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.Any\n actual or perceived security or privacy breach or incident could interrupt our operations, harm our brand and adversely affect our reputation, brand, business,financial condition and results of operations.\nOur\n business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of our users\u2019 personal data and other sensitive data. Additionally, we maintain otherconfidential,\n proprietary, or otherwise sensitive information relating to our business, including intellectual property, and similar information we receive from third parties.An\n increasing number of organizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses, other large Internet companies, financial institutions and governmentinstitutions,\n have disclosed breaches of their information security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved sophisticated and highlytargeted\n attacks. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and may not be known until launchedagainst\n us, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent these attacks. Unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems orfacilities\n we maintain or use in our business through various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or those of our service providers,partners\n or users on our platform, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, service providers, partners, users or others into disclosing rider names, passwords,payment card\n information or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems, or attempting to fraudulently induce ouremployees,\n partners or others into manipulating payment information, resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to criminal actors. In addition, users on our platformcould\n have  vulnerabilities  on  their  own  devices  that  are  entirely  unrelated  to  our  systems  and  platform,  but  could  mistakenly  attribute  their  own  vulnerabilities  to  us.Further,\n breaches  or  incidents  experienced  by  other  companies  may  also  be  leveraged  against  us.  For  example,  credential  stuffing  attacks  are  becoming  increasinglycommon and\n sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to identify and prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored or supported bysignificant financial and tech\nnological resources, making them even more difficult to detect.Although we\n have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our users\u2019 data, prevent data loss and prevent other security breaches or incidents,these\n security measures cannot guarantee total security or prevent incidents from impacting our platform. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerableto cyberattacks or\n security breaches or incidents, including ransomware or other malware that may result in interruptions to our operations or unavailability of our platform,and\n third parties may be able to access our users\u2019 personal information and payment card data that are accessible through those systems. Additionally, as we expand ouroperations,\n including licensing or sharing data with third parties, having employees or third-party relationships in jurisdictions outside the United States, or expand work-from-home\n practices  of  our  employees  (including  increased  use  of  video  conferencing),  our  exposure  to  cyberattacks  or  security  breaches  and  incidents  may  increase.Further,\n employee and service provider error, malfeasance or other errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in an actual or perceivedprivacy\n or security breach or other security incident. Although we have policies restricting access to personal information we store, in the past there have been allegationsregarding violations\n of these policies and we may be subject to these types of allegations in the future. Our third-party service providers also face similar security risks. Weand\n our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, respond to, or mitigate cyberattacks or other sources ofsecurity\n breaches or incidents, and we or they may face difficulties or delays in identifying and responding to cyberattacks and data security breaches and incidents. Inparticular,\n our service providers may also be the targets of cyberattacks, malicious software, phishing schemes, and other attacks, and our third-party service providers\u2019systems and networks may be, or may have been, breached or\n contain exploitable vulnerabilities or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our or their systemsor networks.\nAny actual or perceived privacy or security breach or incident could interrupt our operations\n, result in our platform being unavailable or otherwise disrupted, resultin\n loss, alteration, unavailability or improper use or disclosure of data, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation and brand, damage our relationships withthird-party\n partners, result in regulatory investigations and other proceedings, private claims, demands, litigation and other proceedings, loss of our ability to accept creditor\n debit card payments, increased card processing fees, and other significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure and lead to loss of driver or rider confidence in, ordecreased\n use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any actual or perceived privacy or securitybreach or incident imp\nacting any entities with which we share or disclose data (including, for example, our third-party technology providers, third party autonomous vehicleproviders,\n or other parties with whom we have agreed to share our data under licensing or other commercial arrangements) could have similar effects. In addition, anyactual\n or perceived privacy or security breach or incident impacting any autonomous vehicles, whether through our platform or our competitors\u2019, could result in legal,regulatory\n and financial exposure and lead to loss of rider confidence in our platform, which could significantly undermine our business strategy. Further, any cyberattacksdirected\n toward, or privacy or security breaches or incidents impacting, our competitors could reduce confidence in the ridesharing industry as a whole and, as a result,reduce confidence in us.\nWe\n incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents and we expect our costs will increase as wecontinue\n to implement systems and processes designed to prevent and otherwise address security breaches and incidents. In the event of a future breach or incident, wecould be\n required to expend additional significant capital and other resources in an effort to respond to prevent further breaches or incidents, which may require us to divertsubstantial resources.\n30\n", "Moreover, we could be required or otherwise find it appropriate to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to, notify third parties of, and otherwise addressthe breach or incident \nand its root cause.Additionally,\n defending against claims or litigation based on any actual or perceived privacy or security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, could becostly\n and divert management\u2019s attention. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred,that\n insurance  will  continue  to  be  available  to  us  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  or  at  all,  or  that  any  insurer  will  not  deny  coverage  as  to  any  future  claim.  Thesuccessful\n assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, includingpremium\n increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial conditionand results of operations.\nWe\n primarily  rely  on  Amazon  Web  Services  to  deliver  our  offerings  to users  on  our  platform,  and  any  disruption  of  or interference  with  our  use of  Amazon  WebServices could adversely aff\nect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We\n currently host our platform and support our operations using Amazon Web Services, or AWS, a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We donot\n have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS\u2019 facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurityattacks,\n terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Wehave\n experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors,including\n infrastructure  changes, human  or software  errors,  website  hosting  disruptions  and capacity  constraints.  In addition,  any changes  in AWS\u2019 service  levels  mayadversely affect our \nability to meet the requirements of users. Since our platform\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeatedsystem\n failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peakusage\n times, as we expand and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and mayadversely affect th\ne usage of our offerings.Our commercial agreement with AWS will\n remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after January31,\n 2026, and only after complying with certain advance notice requirements. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or forfailure\n to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminatedor\n we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, newcloud\n infrastructure service providers. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, leadto\n a  significant  short  term  loss  of  revenue,  increase  our  costs  and  impair  our  ability  to  attract  new  users,  any  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financialcondition and results of oper\nations.On\n February 1, 2022 we entered into an addendum to our commercial agreement with AWS, pursuant to which we committed to spend an aggregate of at least$350 million\n between February 2022 and January 2026 on AWS services, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the four years. If we fail to meet the minimumpurchase commitment du\nring any year, we may be required to pay the difference, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We\n rely  on  third-party  and  affiliate  vehicle  rental  partners  for  our  Express  Drive  program  and  Lyft  Rentals  program,  as  well  as  third-party  vehicle  supply,  fleetmanagement\n and finance partners to support our Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals program, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such parties andother risks related to our Express Drive and Lyft Rentals program, our business, f\ninancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\n rely  on  third-party  and  affiliate  vehicle  rental  partners  as  well  as  third-party  vehicle  supply,  fleet  management  and  finance  partners  to  supply  vehicles  todrivers\n for our Express Drive program. If any of our third-party vehicle rental partners or third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners terminates itsrelationship\n with  us  or  refuses  to  renew  its  agreement  with  us  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  the  availability  of  vehicles  for  drivers  in  certain  markets  could  beadversely\n impacted, and we may need to find an alternate  provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable  time frame.Similarly,\n in the event that vehicle manufacturers issue recalls that affect the usage or the supply of vehicles or automotive parts is interrupted, including as a result ofpublic\n health  crises,  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  affecting  vehicles  in  these  partners\u2019  fleets,  the  supply  of  vehicles  available  from  these  partners  could  becomeconstrained. For example, in September 2019, GM issued a recall\n affecting the 2018 Chevy Malibu, which affected a moderate portion of the fleet provided by Lyft\u2019s rentalpartners.\n In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which affected their ability to meet the requirements of our Express Drive program. If we cannotfind\n alternate third-party vehicle rental providers on terms acceptable to us, or these partners\u2019 fleets are impacted by events such as vehicle recalls, we may not be able tomeet\n the driver and consumer demand for rental vehicles, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers and consumers. In addition, due to anumber\n of factors, including our agreements with our vehicle rental partners and our auto-related insurance program, we incur an incrementally higher insurance cost fromour\n Express  Drive  program  compared  to  the  corresponding  cost  from  the  rest  of  our  ridesharing  marketplace  offerings.  If  Flexdrive,  Lyft\u2019s  independently  managedsubsidiary, is unable\n to manage costs of operating Flexdrive\u2019s fleet and potential shortfalls between such costs and the rental fees collected from drivers, Lyft and Flexdrivemay update the pricing m\nethodologies related to Flexdrive\u2019s offering in31\n", "Lyft\u2019s Express Drive program which could increase prices, and in turn adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers.Any\n negative publicity related to any of our third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners, including publicity related to quality standards or safety concerns,could\n adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affectour business, financial condi\ntion and results of operations.Our\n Express Drive program, Lyft Rentals program, and potential future fleet businesses expose us to certain risks, including with respect to decreases in the residualvalue related to the used car market \nvalues, or reductions in the utilization of vehicles in the fleets.For\n the  Lyft  Rentals  consumer  car  rental  business  and,  through  our  independently  managed  subsidiary,  Flexdrive,  for  vehicles  rented  to  drivers  through  ourExpress\n Drive  program,  a  portion  of  the  fleet  is  sourced  from  a  range  of  auto  manufacturers.  In  addition,  we  have  established  environmental  programs,  such  as  ourcommitment\n to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may limit the range of auto manufacturers or vehicles that we source from or purchase. To the extentthat\n any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail production, increase the cost of purchasing cars or decline to sell cars to us on terms or at prices consistent withpast agreements,\n despite sourcing vehicles from the used car market and other efforts to mitigate, we may be unable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles to operate ourExpress Drive or\n Lyft Rentals businesses without significantly increasing fleet costs or reducing volumes. Similarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public healthcrises\n such as the COVID-19 pandemic, make operating rental locations difficult or impossible, or adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or our ability to rentvehicles\n in Lyft Rentals or the Express Drive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the fleets.Reduced utilization has in\ncreased and could continue to increase costs of maintaining the fleets or storing or moving unused vehicles.The\n costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. We currently sell vehicles through auctions, third-party\n resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices. It may be difficult to estimate the residualvalue\n of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those rented to drivers through our Express Drive program. Further, market events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, haveaffected\n the demand for or pricing in the used vehicle market. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, operators of large fleets, such as rental companies, arereportedly\n seeking  to  place  large  volumes  of  vehicles  into  the  resale  market,  which  have  driven  down  the  price  and  corresponding  residual  value  of  used  vehicles.  Areduction in\n residual values for vehicles in the Flexdrive or Lyft Rentals fleets could cause us to sustain a substantial loss on the ultimate sale of such vehicles or require usto depreciate\n those vehicles at a more accelerated rate. If we are unable to obtain and maintain the fleet of vehicles cost-efficiently or if we are unable to accurately forecastthe residual values of veh\nicles in the fleets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\n rely  on  third-party  payment  processors  to  process  payments  made  by  riders  and  payments  made  to  drivers  on  our  platform,  and  if  we  cannot  manage  ourrelationships with such third parties and other payment-rela\nted risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\n rely on a limited number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform. If any of ourthird-party\n payment processors terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find analternate\n payment processor, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable time frame. Further, the software and servicesprovided\n by our third-party payment processors may not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised or experience outages. Any of these riskscould\n cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to drivers on our platform, any of which could makeour platform less conve\nnient and attractive to users and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders.Nearly\n all rider payments and driver payouts are made by credit card, debit card or through third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain paymentnetwork\n or service provider operating rules, to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to riders that may be subject toadditional operating ru\nles, regulations and risks. We may also be subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the payments we accept from riders, includingwith respect\n to money laundering, money transfers, privacy, data protection and information security. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we may besubject\n to civil or criminal penalties, fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which couldmake\n our  offerings  less  convenient  and  attractive  to  riders.  If  any  of  these  events  were  to  occur,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  beadversely affected.\nFor\n example, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable regulation, we could be subject to certain laws, rules and regulations enforcedby\n multiple  authorities  and  governing  bodies  in  the  United  States  and  numerous  state  and  local  agencies  who  may  define  money  transmitter  differently.  For  example,certain\n states may have a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we could be subject to additional laws,rules\n and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations and regulators governingour\n business that we are subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we are not in compliance with suchregulations, we may be subjec\nt to fines or other penalties in one or more32\n", "jurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators, including state Attorneys General, as well as those levied by foreign regulators. In addition to fines, penalties forfailing\n to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions. We couldalso be required to make \nchanges to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.For\n various payment options, we are required to pay fees such as interchange and processing fees that are imposed by payment processors, payment networks andfinancial\n institutions.  These  fees  are  subject  to  increases,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  of  operations.  Additionally,  ourpayment processors requir\ne us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks and which include, amongother\n obligations, requirements to comply with security standards. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules inways\n that might prohibit us from providing certain offerings to some users, be costly to implement or difficult to follow, and if we fail or are alleged to fail to comply withapplicable\n rules or requirements of payment card networks, we may be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments orother\n payment card transactions. We have agreed to reimburse our payment processors for fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we or the users on ourplatform violate th\nese rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We\n rely on other third-party service providers and if such third parties do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may increase andour business, financial condition and results of operations could be advers\nely affected.Our\n success  depends  in  part  on  our  relationships  with  other  third-party  service  providers.  For  example,  we  rely  on  third-party  encryption  and  authenticationtechnologies\n licensed from third parties that are designed to securely transmit personal information provided by drivers and riders on our platform. Further, from time totime,\n we enter into strategic commercial partnerships in connection with the development of new technology, the growth of our qualified driver base, the provision of newor\n enhanced  offerings  for users on our platform  and our expansion into new markets.  If any of our partners  terminates  its relationship  with us, or refuses  to renew itsagreement\n with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such providers inan\n acceptable time frame. We also rely on other software and services supplied by third parties, such as communications and internal software, and our business may beadversely\n affected to the extent such software and services do not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, are compromised or experience outages. Any ofthese\n risks could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any negative publicity related to any of ourthird-party\n partners, including any publicity related to quality standards or safety concerns, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead toincreased regulatory o\nr litigation exposure.We\n incorporate technology from third parties into our platform, products, and services. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectualproperty\n rights  of  others  or  that  the  suppliers  and  licensors  have  sufficient  rights  to  the  technology  in  all  jurisdictions  in  which  we  may  operate.  Some  of  our  licenseagreements\n may be terminated by our licensors for convenience. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this technology because of intellectual propertyinfringement\n claims brought by third parties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue to obtain the technology or enter into newagreements on commer\ncially reasonable terms, our ability to develop our platform or products containing that technology or provide services using that technology could beseverely limited and our business could be harmed. \nAdditionally, if we are unable to obtain necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or developalternate technology, which may\n require significant time and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards. This would limit and delay our ability to providenew or competitive offerings and increase our costs. If\n alternate technology cannot be obtained or developed, we may not be able to offer certain functionality as part of ourofferings, which could adverse\nly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we\n are not able to successfully develop new offerings on our platform and enhance our existing offerings, our business, financial condition and results of operationscould be adversely affect\ned.Our\n ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders and increase utilization of our offerings will dependin\n part on our ability to successfully create and introduce new offerings and to improve upon and enhance our existing offerings. As a result, we may introduce significantchanges\n to  our  existing  offerings  or  develop  and  introduce  new  and  unproven  offerings.  For  example,  in  April  2020,  we  began  piloting  a  delivery  service  platform  inresponse\n to the COVID-19 pandemic. If these new or enhanced offerings are unsuccessful, including as a result of any inability to obtain and maintain required permits orauthorizations or other regulatory constraints or\n because they fail to generate sufficient return on our investments, our business, financial condition and results of operationscould\n be  adversely  affected.  Furthermore,  new  driver  or  rider  demands  regarding  service  or  platform  features,  the  availability  of  superior  competitive  offerings  or  adeterioration\n in the quality of our offerings or our ability to bring new or enhanced offerings to market quickly and efficiently could negatively affect the attractiveness ofour\n platform  and  the  economics  of  our  business  and  require  us  to  make  substantial  changes  to  and  additional  investments  in  our  offerings  or  our  business  model.  Inaddition,\n we  frequently  experiment  with  and  test  different  offerings  and  marketing  strategies.  If  these  experiments  and  tests  are  unsuccessful,  or  if  the  offerings  andstrategies\n we introduce based on the results of such experiments and tests do not perform as expected, our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retainexisting qualified drivers\n and existing riders and maintain or increase utilization of our offerings may be adversely affected.33\n", "Developing and launching new offerings or enhancements to the existing offerings on our platform involves significant risks and uncertainties, including risksrelated\n to  the  reception  of  such  offerings  by  existing  and  potential  future  drivers  and  riders,  increases  in  operational  complexity,  unanticipated  delays  or  challenges  inimplementing such\n offerings or enhancements, increased strain on our operational and internal resources (including an impairment of our ability to accurately forecast riderdemand\n and the number of drivers using our platform), our dependence on strategic commercial partnerships, and negative publicity in the event such new or enhancedofferings\n are perceived to be unsuccessful. We have scaled our business rapidly, and significant new initiatives have in the past resulted in, and in the future may result in,operational\n challenges affecting our business. In addition, developing and launching new offerings and enhancements to our existing offerings may involve significant up-front\n capital  investments  and  such  investments  may  not  generate  return  on  investment.  Further,  from  time  to  time  we  may  reevaluate,  discontinue  and/or  reduce  theseinvestments\n and decide to discontinue one or more offerings. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualifieddrivers\n and riders, our ability to increase utilization of our offerings and our visibility into expected results of operations, and could adversely affect our business, financialcondition\n and results of operations. Additionally, since we are focused on building our community and ecosystems for the long-term, our near-term results of operationsmay be impacted by our inves\ntments in the future.If\n we  are  unable  to  successfully  manage  the  complexities  associated  with  our  expanding  multimodal  platform,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations could be adversely affe\ncted.Our\n expansion into bike and scooter sharing, other modes of transportation, auto repair and collision services, vehicle rental programs and delivery services hasincreased the complexity of our\n business. These new offerings have required us to develop new expertise and marketing and operational strategies, and have subjected us tonew\n laws, regulations and risks. For example, we face the risk that our network of Light Vehicles, our Nearby Transit offering, which integrates third-party public transitdata\n into the Lyft App, and other future transportation offerings could reduce the use of our ridesharing offering. Additionally, from time to time we may reevaluate ourofferings\n on our multimodal platform and decide to discontinue an offering or certain features. Such actions may negatively impact revenue in the short term and may notprovide the benefits we expect in\n the long term. If we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our expanding multimodal platform, including theeffects our new and evolving of\nferings have on our existing business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our new delivery service platform \nmay not be successful and may expose us to additional risks.We\n are in the process of developing and assessing the feasibility of a business-to-business delivery service platform. This offering, which began in April 2020,currently\n allows businesses to send goods from one location to another. Drivers are provided the opportunity to opt-in to receive delivery requests and are currently paidbased on\n a delivery-specific pay structure. Delivery is not currently available in all markets and therefore not all drivers have the opportunity to receive delivery requests atthis time. We face a number \nof challenges that may affect the ultimate success of this offering, including:\u2022\nthe market for this offering may not be sustained following the COVID-19 pandemic, or may not develop at all;\u2022\nwe may be unable to attract and retain drivers for this offering, drivers currently using our platform may not opt-in to drive for this offering, or this offering maydivert drivers from our \nrideshare platform, which may create shortages of driver supply;\u2022\nwe may be unable to attract and retain businesses to participate in this offering;\u2022\nwe may fail to develop an effective pricing model for this offering that incentivizes drivers and businesses to use this offering while maintaining margins for us;\u2022\nour competitors may have more experience with respect to business or consumer deliveries, greater brand recognition in the delivery space, or greater financial orother\n resources that enable them to derive greater revenue, attract and retain drivers and businesses for their similar offerings, and more efficiently provide theirofferings;\n\u2022\nwe may incur additional costs and expenses associated with providing business or consumer delivery services, including insurance-related and other costs;\u2022\nwe may be subject to litigation in a number of areas, including personal injury and automotive liability, and we may be unsuccessful in compelling to arbitrationclaims brought by drivers prov\niding rideshare and delivery services on the Lyft Platform;\u2022\nwe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that are costly to comply with and may affect the profitability of this offering or our ability to offer delivery insome\n markets, including laws and regulations regarding pricing or driver benefits, and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations will adversely affectour deliveries offering;\n34\n", "\u2022the implementation of Proposition 22 in California may have an impact on delivery rate cards, which could impact our competitiveness and ability to operatewithin California; and\n\u2022\nwe may fail to effectively respond to market developments in a timely manner, or at all.Additionally,\n the development of this delivery service platform may divert resources, including management\u2019s attention, from our other offerings and adverselyaffect\n their development. If we are unable to develop and grow our delivery service platform, or unable to do so cost-effectively, whether as a result of our own actions ormarket conditions more g\nenerally, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our\n metrics and estimates, including the key metrics included in this report, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies inthose metrics may harm our reputation and negative\nly affect our business.We regularly\n review and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics used to evaluate our growth, measure our performance and make strategic decisions.These\n metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been evaluated by a third-party. Our metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties orfrom\n similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology or the assumptions on which we rely, and we may make material adjustments to ourprocesses\n for calculating our metrics in order to enhance accuracy, because better information becomes available or other reasons, which may result in changes to ourmetrics.\n The estimates and forecasts we disclose relating to the size and expected growth of our addressable market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets inwhich\n we compete meet the size estimates and growth we have forecasted, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. If investors or analysts do not considerour\n metrics to be accurate representations of our business, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, then the trading price of our Class A common stock andour business, financial condi\ntion and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effe\nctive.Promoting\n awareness of our offerings is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new qualified drivers and new riders and can be costly. Webelieve\n that much of the growth in our rider base and the number of drivers on our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts includereferrals, affiliate\n programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising, television, billboards, radio, video, content, direct mail, social media, email, hiring andclassified\n advertisement  websites,  mobile  \u201cpush\u201d  communications,  search  engine  optimization  and  keyword  search  campaigns.  Our  marketing  initiatives  may  becomeincreasingly\n expensive and generating a meaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketingefforts, it may not offs\net the additional marketing expenses we incur.If\n our marketing efforts are not successful in promoting awareness of our offerings or attracting new qualified drivers and new riders, or if we are not able to cost-effectively\n manage our marketing expenses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. If our marketing efforts are successful in increasing awareness of ourofferings,\n this could also lead to increased public scrutiny of our business and increase the likelihood of third parties bringing legal proceedings against us. Any of theforegoing risks could harm our bus\niness, financial condition and results of operations.Any\n failure to offer high-quality user support may harm our relationships with users and could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial conditionand results of operations.\nOur\n ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders is dependent in part on the ease and reliability of our offerings, including our ability to provide high-quality\n support. Users on our platform depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our offerings, such as being overcharged for a ride, leavingsomething\n in a driver\u2019s vehicle or reporting a safety incident. Our ability to provide effective and timely support is largely dependent on our ability to attract and retainservice\n providers  who  are  qualified  to  support  users  and  sufficiently  knowledgeable  regarding  our  offerings.  As  we  continue  to  grow  our  business  and  improve  ourofferings,\n we will face challenges related to providing quality support services at scale. If we grow our international rider base and the number of international drivers onour\n platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support in languages other than English. Furthermore, theCOVID-19 pandemic\n may impact our ability to provide effective and timely support, including as a result of a decrease in the availability of service providers and increasein\n response time. Any failure to provide efficient user support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation,brand, business, financial cond\nition and results of operations.Failure to deal effectiv\nely with fraud could harm our business.We\n have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data, claims ofunauthorized\n payments by a rider, attempted payments by riders with insufficient funds and fraud committed by riders in concert with drivers. Bad actors use increasinglysophisticated\n methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person\u2019s identity, account information or paymentinformation\n and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details,  bank account information  and mobile phone numbers and accounts. Under current cardpayment practices, we may be liable\n for rides facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit cardtransaction. Despite measures that we have taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraud\nulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot guarantee that anyof our measures will be ef\nfective or35\n", "will  scale  efficiently  with  our  business.  Our  inability  to  adequately  detect  or  prevent  fraudulent  transactions  could  harm  our  reputation  or  brand,  result  in  litigation  orregulatory action and l\nead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We\n have  also  incurred,  and  may  in  the  future  incur,  losses  from  fraud  and  other  misuse  of  our  platform  by  drivers  and  riders,  including  in  connection  withprograms\n we put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have experienced reduced revenue from actual and alleged unauthorized rides fulfilledand\n miles traveled in connection with our Concierge offering. If we are unable to adequately anticipate and address such misuse either through increased controls, platformsolutions or other means, our pa\nrtner relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If\n we fail to effectively match riders on our Shared and Shared Saver Rides offering and manage the related pricing methodologies, our business, financial conditionand results of operations could be adversely af\nfected.Shared and\n Shared Saver Rides enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to benefit from a discounted fare at the cost of possibly longer travel times.With\n a  Shared  or  Shared  Saver  Ride,  when  the  first  rider  requests  a  ride,  our  algorithms  use  the  first  rider\u2019s  destination  and  attempt  to  match  them  with  other  riderstraveling along\n a similar route. If a match between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route.For\n Shared and Shared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to ridersand the\n level of rider demand. We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able tomatch additional riders along the given route, and s\nuch fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride. The fare charged to the riders is decoupled from thepayment made to the driver as we do\n not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match. Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted and charged to ourShared\n or Shared Saver Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that drivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared or Shared Saver Ridesriders, then our business, finan\ncial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we fail to effecti\nvely manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.With\n the adoption of our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn platform andservice fees\n from drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted fare, and the amount earned by a driverbased\n on the actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider, in each case, less any applicable driver bonuses or incentives andany pass-through amounts pai\nd to drivers and third parties. As we do not control the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip,we\n take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider isless\n than  the  amount  we  committed  to  pay  a  driver.  In  addition,  riders\u2019  price  sensitivity  varies  by  geographic  location,  among  other  factors,  and  if  we  are  unable  toeffectively\n account  for  such  variability  in  our  up-front  prices,  our  ability  to  compete  effectively  in  these  locations  could  be  adversely  affected.  If  we  are  unable  toeffectively\n manage our up-front pricing methodology in conjunction with our existing and future pricing and incentive programs, our business, financial condition andresults of operations could b\ne adversely affected.Our company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harm\ned.We\n believe  that  our  company  culture,  which  promotes  authenticity,  empathy  and  support  for  others,  has  been  critical  to  our  success.  We  face  a  number  ofchallenges that may a\nffect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:\u2022\nfailure to identify, attract, reward and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values and mission;\u2022\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\u2022\nshelter-in-place orders in certain jurisdictions where we operate that have required many of our employees to work remotely, as well as permanent return to workarrangements and workplac\ne strategies;\u2022\nthe inability to achieve adherence to our internal policies and core values, including our diversity, equity and inclusion practices and initiatives;\u2022\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision and values;\u2022\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry;\u2022\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;36\n", "\u2022negative perception of our treatment of employees or our response to employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\u2022\nthe provision of employee benefits in the COVID-19 environment; and\u2022\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.From\n time to time, we have undertaken workforce reductions in order to better align our operations with our strategic priorities, managing our cost structure or inconnection with acquisitions. For example, in response to\n the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we took certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs,furloughs\n and salary reductions, which may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees. These actions may adverselyaffect\n our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  personnel  and  maintain  our  culture.  If  we  are  not  able  to  maintain  our  culture,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations could be adverse\nly affected.We\n depend  on  our  key  personnel  and  other  highly  skilled  personnel,  and  if  we  fail  to  attract,  retain,  motivate  or  integrate  our  personnel,  our  business,  financialcondition and results of operations could be adversel\ny affected.Our success depends in part on the continued service of our founder\ns, senior management team, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel and onour\n ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. We may not be successful in attracting andretaining\n qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs and actions we take in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business may harm ourreputation\n or impact our ability to recruit qualified personnel in the future. For example, in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we haveundertaken\n certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs, furloughs and salary reductions, which may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability toattract\n and retain employees. Also, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our management team, work for us on an at-will basis, and there is no assurance that anysuch\n employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may bedifficult\n for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, particularly incritical areas o\nf our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals.We\n face intense competition for highly skilled personnel, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled\n personnel. This competition has intensified in recent periods, and may continue to intensify as the economy recovers from COVID-19. To attract and retain toptalent, we have\n had to offer, and we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and existing personnel oftenconsider\n the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines or we are unable to providecompetitive\n compensation packages, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and we may experience increased attrition. Certainof\n our employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our employees have received and may continue to receivesignificant\n proceeds  from  sales  of  our  equity  in  the  public  markets,  which may  reduce  their  motivation  to  continue  to  work  for  us.  We  may  need  to  invest  significantamounts\n of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train and integrate such employees, and wemay\n never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meetforecasts and employee \nmorale, productivity and retention could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users and unfavorable changes in or our failure to comply withexisting or future laws governing the Internet and mobile de\nvices.Our\n business  depends  on  users\u2019  access  to  our  platform  via  a  mobile  device  and  the  Internet.  We  may  operate  in  jurisdictions  that  provide  limited  Internetconnectivity,\n particularly as we expand internationally. Internet access and access to a mobile device are frequently provided by companies with significant market powerthat\n could take actions that degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of users\u2019 ability to access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of ourplatform rely on in any pa\nrticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device accessibility, even fora short period of time, cou\nld adversely affect our results of operations.Moreover,\n we are subject to a number of laws and regulations specifically governing the Internet and mobile devices that are constantly evolving. Existing andfuture\n laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth and availability of the Internet and online offerings, require us to change our business practices orraise\n compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These laws and regulations, which continue to evolve, cover taxation, privacy and data protection, informationsecurity,\n pricing,  copyrights,  distribution,  mobile  and  other  communications,  advertising  practices,  consumer  protections,  the  provision  of  online  payment  services,unencumbered Internet\n access to our offerings and the characteristics and quality of online offerings, among other things. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to complywith any of\n these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities orothers, which could adversely i\nmpact our results of operations.37\n", "We rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our apps available to the drivers and riders on our platform, and if we do not effectivelyoperate\n with or receive favorable placements within such application marketplaces and maintain high rider reviews, our usage or brand recognition could decline andour business, financial results and results of operations could be advers\nely affected.We\n depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application marketplaces to make our apps available to the driversand\n riders  on  our  platform.  Any  changes  in  such  systems  and  application  marketplaces  that  degrade  the  functionality  of  our apps  or  give  preferential  treatment  to  ourcompetitors\u2019\n apps could adversely affect our platform\u2019s usage on mobile devices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us frommaking\n our  apps  available  to  drivers  and  riders,  make  changes  that  degrade  the  functionality  of  our  apps,  increase  the  cost  of  using  our  apps,  impose  terms  of  useunsatisfactory\n to us or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors\u2019 placement in such mobile operating systems\u2019application marketplace\n is more prominent than the placement of our apps, overall growth in our rider or driver base could slow. Our apps have experienced fluctuations innumber of downloads in the past, and we\n anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition andresults of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will contin\nue to support our platform or effectively rollout\n updates to our apps. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality apps, we need to ensure that our offerings are designed to work effectively with a range of mobiletechnologies,\n systems,  networks  and  standards.  We  may  not  be  successful  in  developing  or  maintaining  relationships  with  key  participants  in  the  mobile  industry  thatenhance drivers\u2019\n and riders\u2019 experience. If drivers or riders on our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our apps on their mobile devices or if we are unableto adapt to changes in popular \nmobile operating systems, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We depend on the interoperability of our plat\nform across third-party applications and services that we do not control.We have integrations with a variety of productivity, collaboration, travel, data management and security ve\nndors. As our offerings expand and evolve, including tothe\n extent we continue to develop autonomous technology, we may have an increasing number of integrations with other third-party applications, products and services.Third-party\n applications, products and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with third-party\n offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors  or technology partners may take actions which disrupt the interoperability  of ourplatform\n with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we operate and distribute our platform. As ourrespective\n products  evolve,  we  expect  the  types  and  levels  of  competition  to  increase.  Should  any  of  our  competitors  or  technology  partners  modify  their  products,standards\n or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives preferential treatment tocompetitive products or s\nervices, our products, platform, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Defects, errors or\n vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems or other technology systems and those of third-party technology providers, or system failures andresulting\n interruptions in our availability or the availability of other systems and providers, could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business,financial condition and results of operations.\nThe\n software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after thecode\n has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as \u201ccontinuous deployment,\u201d which refers to the frequent release of our software code,sometimes\n multiple times per day. This practice increases the risk that errors and vulnerabilities are present in the software code underlying our platform. The third-partysoftware\n that  we  incorporate  into  our  platform  may  also  be  subject  to  errors  or  vulnerability.  Any  errors  or  vulnerabilities  discovered  in  our  code  or  from  third-partysoftware\n after  release  could  result  in  negative  publicity,  a  loss  of  users  or  loss  of  revenue  and  access  or  other  performance  issues.  Such  vulnerabilities  could  also  beexploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of u\nsers on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or incident. We may need to expend significantfinancial\n and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely andeffectively\n resolve any such errors, defects or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as negatively impactour reputation or brand.\nFurther,\n our systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defectsor\n malfunctions,  distributed  denial-of-service  and  other  cyberattacks,  human  error,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  floods,  fires,  natural  disasters,  power  losses,  disruptions  intelecommunications\n services,  fraud,  military  or  political  conflicts,  terrorist  attacks,  computer  viruses,  ransomware,  malware  or  other  events.  Our  systems  also  may  besubject\n to break-ins,  sabotage,  theft  and intentional  acts  of vandalism,  including  by our own employees.  Some of our systems are  not fully  redundant  and our disasterrecovery\n planning  may  not be sufficient  for  all  eventualities.  Our business  interruption  insurance  may  not be  sufficient  to cover  all  of our losses  that  may  result  frominterruptions in our servi\nce as a result of systems failures and similar events.We have experienced and \nwill likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability orreduce or affect th\ne speed or functionality of our offerings. These events have resulted in, and similar38\n", "future events could result in, losses of revenue. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our offeringscould adversely affec\nt our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in harm orlosses to the users using our plat\nform, we may make voluntary payments to compensate for such harm or the affected users could seek monetary recourse or contractualremedies from us for th\neir losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.Our platform contains t\nhird-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrictour ability to provide our offerings.\nOur\n platform  and  offerings  contain  software  modules  licensed  to  us  by  third-party  authors  under  \u201copen  source\u201d  licenses.  Use  and  distribution  of  open  sourcesoftware\n may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification orother\n contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others tocompromise our platfor\nm and offerings.Some\n open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of opensource software we use, or grant o\nther licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could,under\n certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similarofferings\n with  lower  development  effort  and  time  and  ultimately  could  result  in  a  loss  of  our  competitive  advantages.  Alternatively,  to  avoid  the  public  release  of  theaffected portions of our sou\nrce code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.Although we\n have processes for using open source software to avoid subjecting our platform and offerings to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many opensource\n licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipatedconditions\n or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform and offerings. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of opensource\n software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership ofwhat\n we believe to be open source software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our platform will beeffective. If we are held to\n have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or otherliability, or be required t\no seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our offerings on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform,to discontinue or delay\n the provision of our offerings if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available, in source code form, ourproprietary code, any of which \ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n presence  outside  the  United  States  and  any  future  international  expansion  strategy  will  subject  us  to  additional  costs  and  risks  and  our  plans  may  not  besuccessful.\nIn\n 2017, we launched our offerings in Canada and we may continue to expand our international offerings. In addition, we have several international offices thatsupport\n our business. We also transact internationally to source and manufacture bikes and scooters and may increase our business in international regions in the future.Operating\n outside of the United States may require significant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms andcustoms,\n in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering and operations teams. We may incur significant operating expenses and maynot be successful in our inte\nrnational expansion for a variety of reasons, including:\u2022\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;\u2022\ncompetition  from  local  incumbents  that  better  understand  the  local  market,  may  market  and  operate  more  effectively  and  may  enjoy  greater  local  affinity  orawareness;\n\u2022\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our offerings less successful;\u2022\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or viruses;\u2022\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, tax, trade compliance and local regulatoryrestrictions and disclosu\nre requirements;\u2022\nineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries or theft or unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and otherconfidential business info\nrmation;\u2022\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses or other authorizations;\u2022\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;39\n", "\u2022currency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\u2022\npolitical, economic, or social instability, which has caused disruptions in certain of our office locations, including in Belarus and Ukraine;\u2022\ntax policies, treaties or laws that could have an unfavorable business impact; and\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.Our\n limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake may not besuccessful,\n which may result in shutting down international operations or closing international offices. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operationsinternationally and a\nre unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.In\n addition, international expansion has increased our risks in complying with laws and standards in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including with respect tocustoms,\n anti-corruption,  anti-bribery,  export  controls  and trade  and economic  sanctions.  We  cannot assure  you that our employees  and agents will  not take actions  inviolation of applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible\n. In particular, any violation of the applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls andsimilar\n laws  could  result  in  adverse  media  coverage,  investigations,  significant  legal  fees,  loss  of  export  privileges,  severe  criminal  or  civil  sanctions  or  suspension  ordebarment\n from U.S. government contracts, and/or substantial diversion of management\u2019s attention, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand,business, financial condit\nion and results of operations.Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors\nOur\n business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe\n are subject to a wide variety  of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions.  Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs, publiccompanies,\n ridesharing,  worker  classification,  labor  and  employment,  anti-discrimination,  payments,  gift  cards,  whistleblowing  and  worker  confidentiality  obligations,product liability,\n defects, recalls, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, securities, consumer protection,taxation,\n privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobileapplication\n accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, healthcarefraud, waste,\n and abuse, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political contributions,lobbying,\n import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls and delivery of goods including (butnot\n limited  to)  medical  supplies,  perishable  foods  and  prescription  drugs  are  often  complex  and  subject  to  varying  interpretations,  in  many  cases  due  to  their  lack  ofspecificity.\n As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations  are provided byregulatory and governing bodies, su\nch as federal, state and local administrative agencies.The\n ridesharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. When we introduced a peer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace in 2012,the\n laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that were in existence at that time, and some that have since beenadopted,\n were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our relationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharingmarketplace.\n We  have  been  proactively  working  with  federal,  state  and  local  governments  and  regulatory  bodies  to  ensure  that  our  ridesharing  marketplace  and  otherofferings\n are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part due to our efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws related to TNCs to address theunique\n issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted inresponse to our industry and related technologies\n. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courtsmay\n claim that we or users on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or thatusers on\n our platform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with respect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities, includingairports,\n require us to obtain permits, pay fees or comply with certain reporting and other compliance requirements to provide our ridesharing, bike and scooter sharing,auto\n repair and collision services, Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle offerings. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may reject our applications forpermits,\n revoke existing or deny renewals of permits to operate, delay our ability to operate, increase their fees, charge new types of fees, or impose fines and penalties,including\n as  a  result  of  errors  in,  or  failures  to  comply  with,  reporting  or  other  requirements  related  to  our  product  offerings.  Any  of  the  foregoing  actions  by  thesejurisdictions and governmen\ntal entities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Recent\n financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and companiesengaged\n in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations thatare\n adverse to our business, or, due to changes in our operations and structure or partner relationships as a result of changes in the market or otherwise, they may viewmatters or interpret\n40\n", "laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. See the risk factor entitled \u201cChallenges to contractor classification ofdrivers\n that  use  our  platform  may  have  adverse  business,  financial,  tax,  legal  and  other  consequences  to  our  business.\u201d  Such  regulatory  scrutiny  or  action  may  createdifferent\n or  conflicting  obligations  from  one  jurisdiction  to  another,  and  may  have  a  negative  outcome  that  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operations,  financialcondition,\n and results of operations. Additionally, we have invested and from time to time we will continue to invest resources in an attempt to influence or challengelegislation\n and  other  regulatory  matters  pertinent  to  our  operations,  particularly  those  related  to  the  ridesharing  industry,  which  may  negatively  impact  the  legal  andadministrative\n proceedings  challenging  the  classification  of  drivers  on  our  platform  as  independent  contractors  if  we  are  unsuccessful  or  lead  to  additional  costs  andexpenses\n even if we are successful. These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial conditionand results of operations.\nOur industry is\n relatively nascent and is rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipalregulatory authorities across the United States an\nd Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing.For\n example, in December 2018, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings calculations and utilization ratesapplicable to our\n ridesharing platform, as well as certain other ridesharing platforms. Our legal challenge was unsuccessful and other cities are exploring similar legislation.The\n City  of  Seattle  adopted  the  Transportation  Network  Company  Driver  Minimum  Compensation  Ordinance  effective  January  1,  2021,  which  sets  minimum  driverearnings calculations for\n our rideshare platform as well as other rideshare platforms. The City of Portland is also exploring driver earnings legislation. Other jurisdictions inwhich\n we currently operate or may want to operate could follow suit. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operationsinternationally,\n particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on ormaterial limi\ntations to our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n success, or perceived success, and increased visibility has driven, and may continue to drive, some businesses that perceive our business model negatively toraise\n their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations have and may continue to take actionsand\n employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to changesuch legal and regulatory \nregimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of drivers and riders to utilize our platform.Any of the foregoing risks could har\nm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Challenges to contractor classificat\nion of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.We\n are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedingsat\n the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a driver is anindependent\n contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification ofindependent\n contractors  are  subject  to  changes  and  divergent  interpretations  by  various  authorities  which  can  create  uncertainty  and  unpredictability  for  us.  For  moreinformation\n regarding the litigation in which we have been involved, see the \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d subheading in Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes tothe\n Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, in 2021, the U.S. Secretary of Labor expressed his viewthat\n in  some  cases  \u201cgig  workers  should  be  classified  as  employees\u201d  and  that  further  review  was  ongoing.  We  continue  to  maintain  that  drivers  on  our  platform  areindependent contractors \nin such legal and administrative proceedings and intend to continue to defend ourself vigorously in these matters, but our arguments may ultimatelybe\n unsuccessful. A determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver of a ridesharingplatform as an employe\ne, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of:\u2022\nmonetary  exposure  arising  from  or  relating  to  failure  to  withhold  and  remit  taxes,  unpaid  wages  and  wage  and  hour  laws  and  requirements  (such  as  thosepertaining\n to failure  to pay minimum  wage and overtime,  or to provide  required  breaks  and wage statements),  expense  reimbursement,  statutory  and punitivedamages, penalties, inc\nluding related to the California Private Attorneys General Act, and government fines;\u2022\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\u2022\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment;\u2022\nclaims of discrimination, harassment and retaliation under civil rights laws;\u2022\nclaims under new or existing laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining and other concerted activity;\u2022\nother  claims,  charges  or  other  proceedings  under  laws  and  regulations  applicable  to  employers  and  employees,  including  risks  relating  to  allegations  of  jointemployer liability o\nr agency liability; and41\n", "\u2022harm to our reputation and brand.In\n addition to the harms listed above, a determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding that classifies a driver on a ridesharing platform as an employeemay require us\n to significantly alter our existing business model and/or operations (including suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costsand impact\n our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations and our a\nbility to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.We\n have  been  involved  in  numerous  legal  proceedings  related  to  driver  classification.  We  are  currently  involved  in  several  putative  class  actions,  severalrepresentative\n actions  brought,  for  example,  pursuant  to  California\u2019s  Private  Attorney  General  Act,  several  multi-plaintiff  actions  and  thousands  of  individual  claims,including\n those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to our Terms of Service to arbitration, challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independentcontractors.\n We are also involved in administrative audits related to driver classification in California, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey. See thesection titled \u201cLega\nl Proceedings\u201d for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.Claims by others that we infringed their proprietar\ny technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.Companies\n in the markets in which we operate are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual propertyrights.\n In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or otherwiseobtained.\n As  we  gain  an  increasingly  high  public  profile  and  the  number  of  competitors  in  our  market  increases  and  as  we  continue  to  develop  new  technologies  andintellectual\n property, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows based on the following: increase in public profile, increases in the number ofcompetitors in our mark\nets, our continued development of new technologies, new products and services, and new IP, as well as potential international expansion. From timeto time third parties may\n assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d foradditional\n information about these types of legal proceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of intellectual propertyinfringement and,\n in some instances, have initiated licensing discussions. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses, there can be no assurance that we will besuccessful\n in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and others may now and in the future havesignificantly larger and more mature patent\n portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding companies orother adverse\n patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.Many\n potential  litigants,  including  some  of  our  competitors  and  patent-holding  companies,  have  the  ability  to  dedicate  substantial  resources  to  assert  their  intellectualproperty\n rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distractour\n management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required inconnection\n with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantialdamages,\n royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us fromusing\n or distributing our intellectual property, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adverselyaffect our business, finan\ncial condition and results of operations.With\n respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights, which maynot\n be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-exclusive, and thereforeour\n competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third-party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all,we may\n be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology or other intellectual property, which could require significant time (during which we would be unableto\n continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of oper\nations.Failure to protect or enforce our intell\nectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n success is dependent in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as code, information, data, processes and other forms ofinformation,\n knowhow and technology), or intellectual property, and as we grow, we will continue to develop intellectual property that is important for our existing orfuture\n business. We  rely  on a combination  of patents,  copyrights,  trademarks,  service  marks,  trade  dress, trade  secret  laws and contractual  restrictions  to establish  andprotect\n our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and may vary by jurisdiction. Even if wedo\n detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming andexpensive and\n could divert management attention. While we take precautions designed to protect our intellectual property, it may still be possible for competitors and otherunauthorized\n third parties to copy our technology, reverse engineer our data and use our proprietary information to create or enhance competing solutions and services,which\n could adversely affect our position in our rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Some license provisions that protect against unauthorized use, copying,transfer and disclosure o\nf our technology may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and42\n", "foreign countries. The laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property as do the laws of the United States and effectiveintellectual\n property  protections  may  not  be  available  or  may  be  limited  in  foreign  countries.  Our  domestic  and  international  intellectual  property  protection  andenforcement\n strategy is influenced by many considerations including costs, where we have business operations, where we might have business operations in the future,legal\n protections available in a specific jurisdiction, and/or other strategic considerations. As such, we do not have identical or analogous intellectual property protection inall\n jurisdictions, which could risk freedom to operate in certain jurisdictions if we were to expand. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorizeduse,\n copying,  transfer  and  disclosure  of  proprietary  information  will  likely  increase.  We  may  need  to  expend  additional  resources  to  protect,  enforce  or  defend  ourintellectual\n property  rights domestically  or internationally,  which could  impair  our business or adversely  affect  our domestic  or international  operations.  We  enter  intoconfidentiality\n and  invention  assignment  agreements  with  our  employees  and  consultants  and  enter  into  confidentiality  agreements  with  our  third-party  providers  andstrategic\n partners.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  these  agreements  will  be  effective  in  controlling  access  to,  and  use  and  distribution  of,  our  platform  and  proprietaryinformation.\n Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ourofferings.\n Competitors and other third parties may also attempt to reverse engineer our data which would compromise our trade secrets and other rights. We also enter intostrategic partnerships, joint\n development and other similar agreements with third parties where intellectual property arising from such partnerships may be jointly-owned ormay\n be transferred or licensed to the counterparty. Such arrangements may limit our ability to protect, maintain, enforce or commercialize such intellectual property rights,including\n requiring agreement with or payment to our joint development partners before protecting, maintaining, licensing or initiating enforcement of such intellectualproperty\n rights, and may allow such joint development partners to register, maintain, enforce or license such intellectual property rights in a manner that may affect thevalue of the jointly-owned in\ntellectual property or our ability to compete in the market.We\n may  be  required  to  spend  significant  resources  in  order  to  monitor  and  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights,  and  some  violations  may  be  difficult  orimpossible to detect. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights coul\nd be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in theimpairment\n or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuitsattacking the\n validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology against unauthorizedcopying or use,\n as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, could impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductionsof\n enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or harm our reputation or brand. In addition, we may berequired\n to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new offerings or platform features, which may not be on commercially reasonable termsor at all and could advers\nely affect our ability to compete.Our\n industry has also been subject to attempts to steal intellectual property, particularly regarding autonomous vehicle technology, including by foreign actors.We,\n along with others in our industry, have been the target of attempted thefts of our intellectual property and may be subject to such attempts in the future. Although wetake\n measures to protect our property, if we are unable to prevent the theft of our intellectual property or its exploitation, the value of our investments may be underminedand our business, financial cond\nition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.Changes in laws or regulations relatin\ng to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply withsuch\n laws  and  regulations  or  any  other  obligations  relating  to  privacy,  data  protection  or  the  protection  or  transfer  of  personal  data,  could  adversely  affect  ourbusiness.\nWe\n receive,  transmit  and  store  a  large  volume  of  personally  identifiable  information  and  other  data  relating  to  the  users  on  our  platform.  Numerous  local,municipal, state,\n federal and international laws and regulations address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of certaintypes\n of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault ofNon-Solicited\n Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Law, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, the U.S. Federal Health InsurancePortability\n and  Accountability  Act  of  1996,  or  HIPAA,  Section  5(c)  of  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  Act,  the  California  Consumer  Privacy  Act,  or  CCPA,  and  theCalifornia Privacy Rights Act,\n or CPRA, which becomes operative on January 1, 2023. These laws, rules and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continuallychange, through new legislation, \namendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, theCPRA\n will require new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information.The\n CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcementremain\n unclear. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies andincur additional compl\niance-related costs and expenses. Additionally, other states have considered or have enacted legislation similar to the CCPA and CPRA. For example,on\n March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or CDPA, which becomes effective on January 1, 2023, and on June 8, 2021, Coloradoenacted\n the Colorado Privacy Act, or CPA, which takes effect on July 1, 2023. These new and modified state laws, including the CPRA, and other changes in laws orregulations\n relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly any new or modified laws or regulations that require enhanced protection of certaintypes of data or new obligations wi\nth regard to data retention, transfer or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our offerings, require43\n", "significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from providing certain offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which we may operate in thefuture.\nFurther, as we continue to expand our p\nlatform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional privacy-related laws and regulations. For example, inconnection with the\n sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division to Woven Planet, we have entered into certain data sharing and other agreements with Woven Planet tofacilitate\n and accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology. Changes in the law or regulatory landscape could limit or prohibit activities in this regard.Further,\n the  collection  and  storage  of  data  in  connection  with  the  use  of  our  Concierge  and  Lyft  Pass  for  Healthcare  offerings  by  healthcare  partners  subjects  us  tocompliance\n requirements under HIPAA. HIPAA and its implementing regulations contain requirements regarding the use, collection, security, storage and disclosure ofindividuals\u2019\n protected health information, or PHI. In 2009, HIPAA was amended by the HITECH Act to impose certain of HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security requirementsdirectly\n upon  business  associates  of  covered  entities.  Contracted  healthcare  entities  including  healthcare  providers,  health  plans,  and  transportation  brokers  using  ourConcierge\n or Lyft Pass for Healthcare offerings are either covered entities or business associates under HIPAA. We must also comply with HIPAA as we use and disclosethe\n PHI of riders in our capacity as a business associate of other contracted healthcare entities. Compliance obligations under HIPAA include privacy, security and breachnotification obligations,\n and could subject us to increased liability for any unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI determined to be a \u201cbreach.\u201d If we knowingly breach theHITECH\n Act\u2019s requirements, we could be exposed to criminal liability. A breach of our safeguards and processes could expose us to civil penalties that range from $100 -$50,000 per violation, with an annual \nmaximum per violation calendar year cap of $1.5 million for \u201cwillful neglect\u201d violations and the possibility of civil litigation.Additionally,\n we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection and information securitystandards\n and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA and CPRAimposing\n new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, wemay\n face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effortto\n do so. In particular, with regard to HIPAA, we may incur increased costs as we perform our obligations to our healthcare customers under our agreements with them. Aswe\n consider expansion of business offerings and markets and as laws and regulations change, we expect to incur additional costs related to privacy, data protection andinformation\n security standards and protocols imposed by laws, regulations, industry standards or contractual obligations related to such offerings and face additional risksthat such expansion could be incons\nistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of such laws, regulations or obligations.Despite our efforts to comp\nly with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible thatour\n practices, offerings or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, orthe failure\n by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or informationsecurity,\n or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personally identifiable information or other driver or rider data, or theperception\n that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing drivers and riders from usingour\n platform  or  result  in  fines  or  proceedings  by  governmental  agencies  and  private  claims  and  litigation,  any  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financialcondition and\n results of operations. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of concerns relating to privacy, data protection or information security, whether ornot valid, may harm our repu\ntation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are\n regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.\nWe\n are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary courseof\n business,  including  those  involving  personal  injury,  property  damage,  worker  classification,  labor  and  employment,  anti-discrimination,  commercial  disputes,competition,\n consumer complaints, intellectual property disputes, compliance with regulatory requirements, securities laws, and other matters, and we may become subjectto\n additional  types  of  claims,  lawsuits,  government  investigations  and  legal  or  regulatory  proceedings  as  our  business  grows  and  as  we  deploy  new  offerings  such  asautonomous\n vehicle  technology,  Driver  Centers  and  Mobile  Services,  Lyft  Auto  Care,  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles  and  deliveries,  including  proceedings  related  toproduct\n liability  or  our  acquisitions,  securities  issuances  or  business  practices.  We  are  also  regularly  subject  to  claims,  lawsuits,  arbitration  proceedings,  governmentinvestigations\n and other legal and regulatory proceedings seeking to hold us liable for the actions of independent contractor drivers on our platform. See the section titled\u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for add\nitional information about these types of legal proceedings.The\n results  of any such claims,  lawsuits, arbitration  proceedings,  government  investigations  or other legal  or regulatory  proceedings  cannot be predicted  withcertainty.\n Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  time-consuming,  result  in  costly  litigation,  be  harmful  to  our  reputation,  require  significantmanagement\n attention  and divert  significant  resources.  Determining  reserves  for our pending litigation  is a complex  and fact-intensive  process that requires  significantsubjective\n judgment  and  speculation.  It  is  possible  that  a  resolution  of  one  or  more  such  proceedings  could  result  in  substantial  damages,  settlement  costs,  fines  andpenalties that could adv\nersely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These proceedings could also44\n", "result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions or other orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequencescould adversely\n affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligationsto indemnify and to incur l\negal expenses on behalf of our business, commercial, and government partners and current and former directors and officers.A\n determination  in,  or  settlement  of,  any  legal  proceeding,  whether  we  are  party  to  such  legal  proceeding  or  not,  that  involves  our  industry,  could  harm  ourbusiness,\n financial condition and results of operations. For example, a determination that classifies a driver of a ridesharing platform as an employee, whether we are partyto such determination or no\nt, could cause us to incur significant expenses or require substantial changes to our business model.In\n addition,  we regularly  include  arbitration  provisions  in  our Terms  of  Service  with the  drivers  and riders  on our platform.  These  provisions  are  intended  tostreamline\n the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However,arbitration\n may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and the use of arbitration provisions may subject us tocertain\n risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation andbrand,\n we have in the past and may continue to limit our use of arbitration provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which couldincrease our litiga\ntion costs and exposure. For example, effective May 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by users and employees.Further,\n with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federallaw,\n there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If ourarbitration agreements were found to be\n unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increasein\n our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which couldadversely affect our bus\niness, financial condition and results of operations.As\n we expand our platform offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such lawsand\n regulations  or  manage  the  increased  costs  associated  with  such  laws  and  regulations  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations.\nAs\n we continue to expand our platform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict from onejurisdiction\n to another. Many of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of our industry and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate oraddress the unique issues fac\ned by our industry.For\n example, contracting with healthcare entities and transportation brokers representing healthcare entities may subject us to certain healthcare related laws andregulations.\n These laws and regulations may impose additional requirements on us and our platform in providing access to rides through the Lyft Platform on behalf ofhealthcare\n partners. Additional requirements may arise related to the collection and storage of data and systems infrastructure design, all of which could increase the costsassociated\n with  our  offerings  to  healthcare  partners.  With  respect  to  our  healthcare  rides  matched  through  the  Lyft  Platform  and  provided  to  Medicaid  or  MedicareAdvantage\n beneficiaries, we are subject to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws that impose penalties for violations. Significant violations of such laws could lead to ourloss\n of Medicaid provider enrollment status, and could also potentially result in exclusion from the federal programs as an authorized transportation platform provider.Further,\n we may in certain circumstances be or become considered a government contractor with respect to certain of our services, which would expose us to certain riskssuch as the government\u2019s ability to unilaterally terminate contracts, the public sector\u2019s budgetary cycles and funding aut\nhorization, and the government\u2019s administrative andinvestigatory processes.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulation\ns and other obligations relating to our platform offerings, it is possible that our practices, offerings orplatform\n could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party\n providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to our platform offerings, could harm our reputation and brand,discourage\n new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform, lead to refunds of rider fares or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies or privateclaims and litigat\nion, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We face the risk of litigat\nion resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.The\n actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws.For example,\n the TCPA restricts certain telemarketing and the use of certain automated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted and may in the futureresult\n in civil claims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving anddeveloping.\n If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations could be adversely affected.45\n", "If  we  fail  to  maintain  an  effective  system  of  disclosure  controls  and  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  our  ability  to  produce  timely  and  accurate  financialstatements or comply with applicab\nle regulations could be impaired.As\n a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and thelisting\n standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and proceduresand\n internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information requiredto be disclosed\n by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and formsand\n that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We arealso continuing\n to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order tomaintain and improve th\ne effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.Our\n current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business, including increasedcomplexity\n resulting from any international expansion, the expanded work-from-home practices of our employees in response to COVID-19 and permanent work-from-home\n and  hybrid  work  arrangements,  new  offerings  on  our  platform  or  from  strategic  transactions,  including  acquisitions  and  divestitures.  Further,  weaknesses  in  ourdisclosure\n controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficultiesencountered\n in  their  implementation  or  improvement,  could  harm  our  results  of  operations  or  cause  us  to  fail  to  meet  our  reporting  obligations  and  may  result  in  arestatement\n of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adverselyaffect\n the  results  of  periodic  management  evaluations  and  annual  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  attestation  reports  regarding  the  effectiveness  of  ourinternal\n control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control overfinancial reporting could\n also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely adversely affect the market price of ourClass A common stock. In addition, if we \nare unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.Our independent\n registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control overfinancial\n reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have anadverse effect on our busin\ness, financial condition and results of operations and could cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.Taxing\n authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added or similar taxes andmay\n successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments or obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as\n sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipts tax, to businesses like ours andto drivers is a complex\n and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of theInternet\n and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates andare\n subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or todrivers\u2019 businesses.\nIn\n addition, local governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislativeaction\n to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. For example, it is becoming more common for local governments to impose per trip fees specifically onTNC rides.\n As one example, voters in San Francisco approved \u201cProposition D\u201d in November of 2019, which imposes a percentage-based tax on TNC rides originating inthe city.\n Such taxes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We\n are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, andwe\n may face indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities have raisedand may\n continue to raise questions about or challenge or disagree with our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes, and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictionsin\n which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and interest. A successful assertion by one or more taxauthorities requiring\n us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes,could\n result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past transactions, as well as penalties and interest, and could discourage drivers and riders from utilizing ourofferings\n or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  of  operations.  Although  we  have  reserved  for  potential  payments  of  possible  past  taxliabilities in our financial stateme\nnts, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.Additionally,\n one  or  more  states,  localities  or  other  taxing  jurisdictions  may  seek  to  impose  additional  reporting,  record-keeping  or  indirect  tax  collectionobligations\n on businesses like ours. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,collect and remit indirect taxes f\nor transactions taking place46\n", "over the Internet, and are considering related legislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South  Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., certain  states have enacted laws thatwould\n require tax reporting, collection or tax remittance on items sold online. Requiring tax reporting or collection could decrease driver or rider activity, which wouldharm\n our business. New legislation may require us or drivers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection andremittance and audi\nt requirements, which could make our offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As\n a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any suchdifference\n may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome isdetermined.\nOperating as\n a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, certain members of our managementteam have limited exper\nience managing a public company.As\n a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to thereporting requirements of the\n Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, therules\n and  regulations  of  the  SEC  and  the  listing  standards  of  the  Nasdaq  Stock  Market.  For  example,  the  Exchange  Act  requires,  among  other  things,  we  file  annual,quarterly\n and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls andprocedures\n and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financialcompliance\n costs,  and  increase  demand  on  our  systems.  In  addition,  as  a  public  company,  we  may  be  subject  to  stockholder  activism,  which  can  lead  to  additionalsubstantial\n costs,  distract  management  and  impact  the  manner  in  which  we  operate  our  business  in  ways  we  cannot  currently  anticipate.  As  a  result  of  disclosure  ofinformation\n in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation,including by competitors.\nCertain\n members  of  our  management  team  have  limited  experience  managing  a  publicly  traded  company,  interacting  with  public  company  investors  andcomplying\n with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being apublic\n company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts andinvestors.\n These  obligations  and  constituents  will  require  significant  attention  from  our  senior  management  and  could  divert  their  attention  away  from  the  day-to-daymanagement of our business, which \ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Climate change may have a long-term i\nmpact on our business.We have established environmental programs, such as our\n commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, and requiring our suppliers to ensure theefficient\n use  of  raw  materials,  water,  and  energy  resources  via  our  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct, and  we  recognize  that  there  are  inherent  climate-related  risks  whereverbusiness\n is  conducted.  For  example,  our  San  Francisco,  California  headquarters  is  projected  to  be  vulnerable  to  future  water  scarcity  and  sea  level  rise  due  to  climatechange,\n as well as climate-related events including wildfires and associated power shut-offs. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weatherevents\n and their impact on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of ourcustomers,\n and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climatechange policies\n such as California\u2019s Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program, which imposes greenhouse gas and EV requirements on our industry, and failure to meetthe\n future requirements could have adverse impacts on our costs and ability to operate in California, as well as public goodwill towards our company. We advocate for EVprograms\n that can be efficiently accessed by drivers on our platform and rental car operators, and any failure of such programs to address EV capital costs, EV chargingcosts,\n and  EV  charging  infrastructure  in  the  context  of  transportation  network  companies\u2019  unique  needs  could  challenge  our  ability  to  progress  toward  our  100%  EVcommitment.\n Furthermore, these EV programs are asset-intensive and require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance,depreciation,\n asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise notsuccessful,\n our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. We may also enter into arrangements with thirdparties\n for financing, leasing or otherwise, to enable us to meet our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030. Such transactions may require us toprovide\n guarantees for financing. We may also benefit from certain tax credits for EVs and, if such tax credits expire or are terminated or we are otherwise unable to usethem, we may not realiz\ne the benefits we have planned and our business and financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.Risks Related to Financing and Transactional Factors\nWe may require additional capital, which ma\ny not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.Historically,\n we funded our capital-intensive operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our operations. Tosupport our\n growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our offerings, including potential new offerings. In May 2020,we issued $747.5 million in aggrega\nte principal amount47\n", "of our 2025 Notes and, from time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, including by the issuance of securities. If we raise additional funds through theissuance\n of  equity,  equity-linked  or  debt  securities,  such  as  our  2025  Notes,  those  securities  may  have  rights,  preferences  or  privileges  senior  to  those  of  our  Class  Acommon\n stock,  and  our  existing  stockholders  may  experience  dilution.  Further,  we  have  secured  debt  financing  which  has  resulted  in  fixed  obligations  and  certainrestrictive\n covenants,  and  any  debt  financing  secured  by  us  in  the  future  would  result  in  increased  fixed  obligations  and  could  involve  additional  restrictive  covenantsrelating\n to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, as well as liens on some or all of our assets, which may make it more difficult for us toobtain additional capi\ntal and to pursue business opportunities.We\n evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, businessplans\n and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. Additionally, COVID-19 may impact our access to capital andmake\n additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to us. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorableterms,\n or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our businessgrowth and to respond to business chall\nenges could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If\n we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, or if we enter into strategic transactions that do not achieveour objectives, our business, results of operations and financial \ncondition could be adversely affected.As\n part  of  our  business  strategy,  we  will  continue  to  consider  a  wide  array  of  potential  strategic  transactions,  including  acquisitions  of  businesses,  newtechnologies,\n services  and  other  assets  and  strategic  investments  that  complement  our  business,  such  as  our  acquisition  of  Flexdrive  in  February  2020,  as  well  asdivestitures,\n partnerships and other transactions. We have previously acquired and continue to evaluate targets and other opportunities that operate in relatively nascentmarkets.\n As we grow, we also may explore investments in new technologies, which we may develop or other parties may develop. We may also explore acquisitions, jointventures,\n or  other  strategic  partnerships  that  result  in  our  products  or  services  entering  new  markets.  There  is  no  assurance  that  such  acquired  businesses  will  besuccessfully\n integrated into our business or generate substantial revenue, that our investments in other technologies will generate returns for our business, or that we willnot lose our initial inves\ntment with strategic investments.Acquisitions involve numerous risks, \nany of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\u2022\nintense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase acquisition costs and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable oracceptable terms;\n\u2022\nfailure or material delay in closing a transaction;\u2022\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\u2022\nour ability to successfully obtain indemnification or representation and warranty insurance;\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company;\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\u2022\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities;\u2022\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\u2022\nfailure  to  identify  the  problems,  liabilities  or  other  shortcomings  or  challenges  of  an  acquired  company  or  technology,  including  issues  related  to  intellectualproperty, regulatory com\npliance practices, litigation, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\u2022\nrisks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired company or business;\u2022\ntheft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\u2022\nrisk that an acquired company or investment in new offerings cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\u2022\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition.In\n addition, we may divest businesses or assets or enter into joint ventures, strategic partnerships or other strategic transactions. For example, in July 2021, weclosed\n the  sale  of  our  Level  5  self-driving  vehicle  division.  These  types  of  transactions  present  certain  risks;  for  example,  we  may  not  achieve  the  desired  strategic,operational\n and  financial  benefits  of  a  divestiture,  partnership,  joint  venture  or  other  strategic  transaction.  Further,  during  the  pendency  of  a  divestiture  or  during  theintegration or\n48\n", "separation process of any strategic transaction, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business, loss of employees, customers, or suppliers.If\n we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services andother\n assets, strategic investments or other transactions, or if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, or if we are unable to successfully completeother transactions or such \ntransactions do not meet our strategic objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Servicing our current and future debt may require a signifi\ncant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness.Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit \nthe funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating ourbusiness or otherwise adversely affect our resul\nts of operations.In May\n 2020, we issued our 2025 Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Flexdrive, whichis\n now  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Flexdrive  remained  responsible  for  its  obligations  under  a  Loan  and  Security  Agreement,  as  amended,  with  a  third-party  lender,  aMaster\n Vehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender and a Vehicle Procurement Agreement, as amended, with a third-party;\n and, following the acquisition, we continued to guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed under these agreements. See Note 10 \"Debt\" to ourconsolidated\n financial statements, for further information on these agreements and our outstanding debt obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we had $711.4 million ofindebtedness for borrowed money outs\ntanding.Our ability to make schedul\ned payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subjectto\n economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service ourdebt\n and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets,restructuring\n debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any existing or futureindebtedness\n will  depend  on  the  capital  markets  and  our  financial  condition  at  such  time.  We  may  not  be  able  to  engage  in  any  of  these  activities  or  engage  in  theseactivities\n on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants thatmay\n prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, couldresult in the accel\neration of our debt.In\n addition,  our  indebtedness,  combined  with  our  other  financial  obligations  and  contractual  commitments,  could  have  other  important  consequences.  Forexample, it could:\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in governmentregulation;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes; and\u2022\nmake an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.Further,\n as  of  January  1,  2022,  LIBOR  settings  for  all  non-U.S.  dollar  currencies  and  U.S.  dollar  one-week  and  two-month  LIBOR  settings  ceased  beingpublished,\n provided or representative. InterContinental Benchmark Exchange and the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority have confirmed that LIBOR settingsfor all\n remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will cease to be published, provided or representative after June 30, 2023. If new methods of calculating LIBOR are establishedor if other benchmark rates\n used to price indebtedness or investments are established, the terms of any existing or future indebtedness or investments, including the terms ofFlexdrive\u2019s debt instrumen\nts, may be negatively impacted, resulting in increased interest expense or lower than expected interest income.In\n addition, under certain of our and our subsidiary\u2019s existing debt instruments, we and Flexdrive are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenantsregarding our\n business and operations, including limitations on Flexdrive\u2019s ability to enter into certain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions.If\n we or Flexdrive, as applicable, do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, and do not obtain a waiver or consent from the lenders,then,\n subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involveadditional\n restrictive  covenants  relating  to  our  capital-raising  activities  and  other  financial  and  operational  matters,  which  may  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  obtainadditional capital\n to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay ourloans immediately, and \nmay limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.49\n", "Any of these factors could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to ourbusiness and our ability to serv\nice or repay our indebtedness would increase.We are subject to counterparty risk with respe\nct to the capped call transactions.In\n connection  with  the  issuance  of  our  2025  Notes,  we  entered  into  the  capped  call  transactions,  or  Capped  Calls.  The  option  counterparties  are  financialinstitutions,\n and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Capped Calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties willnot be secured\n by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If anoption\n counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that timeunder\n the  Capped  Calls  with  such  option  counterparty.  Our  exposure  will  depend  on  many  factors  but,  generally,  an  increase  in  our  exposure  will  be  correlated  to  anincrease\n in  the  market  price  and  in  the  volatility  of  our  Class  A  common  stock.  In  addition,  upon  a  default  by  an  option  counterparty,  we  may  suffer  adverse  taxconsequences\n and  more  dilution  than  we  currently  anticipate  with  respect  to  our  Class  A  common  stock.  We  can  provide  no  assurance  as  to  the  financial  stability  orviability of the option coun\nterparties.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other \ntax attributes may be limited.As\n of December 31, 2021, we had $7.5 billion of federal and $6.7 billion of state net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) available to reduce future taxable income, whichwill begin to\n expire in 2030 for federal and 2022 for state purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use NOLs before their expiration, or atall.\n Under Section  382 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended,  if  a corporation  undergoes  an \u201cownership  change,\u201d  the  corporation\u2019s  ability  to  use its  pre-change\n NOLs to offset  its  post-change  income  may  be  limited.  In  general,  an  \u201cownership  change\u201d  will  occur  if  there  is  a cumulative  change  in  our ownership  by  \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d \nthat exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Our ability to use net operating lossesto\n reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes and ownership changes that may occur in thefuture.\nThe\n Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act, among other things, includes changes to the rules governingour\n U.S. Federal NOLs. NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 are subject to an 80% of taxable income limitation (as calculated before taking theNOLs\n into account) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. In addition, NOLs arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are subject to a five-year carryback andindefinite\n carryforward, while NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 also are subject to indefinite carryforward but cannot be carried back. Not allstates conform to the Tax Act or CARE\nS Act and some states have varying conformity to the Tax Act or CARES Act. In future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset isrecognized\n related to our NOLs, the changes in the carryforward/carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our valuationallowance assessments for NOLs gene\nrated after December 31, 2017.Risks Related to Governance and Ownership of our Capital Stock Factors\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effe\nct of concentrating voting power with our Co-Founders, which will limit your ability to influence the outcomeof important transactions, including a change in control.\nOur\n Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the issued andoutstanding\n shares  of  our  Class  B  common  stock.  Accordingly,  Logan  Green,  our  co-founder,  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  a  member  of  our  board  of  directors  holdsapproximately 21.42% of the voting power of our\n outstanding capital stock; and John Zimmer, our co-founder and President and Vice Chair of our board of directors, holdsapproximately\n 12.63% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, our Co-Founders, individually or together, will be able to significantly influencematters\n submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale ofall or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our C\no-Founders, individually or together, may have interests that differ from yours and may votein\n a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a changein\n control  of  our  company,  could  deprive  our  stockholders  of  an  opportunity  to  receive  a  premium  for  their  capital  stock  as  part  of  a  sale  of  our  company  and  mightultimately\n affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Each Co-Founder\u2019s voting power is as of December 31, 2021 and includes shares of Class A commonstock expected to be issued upon th\ne vesting of such Co-Founder\u2019s RSUs within 60 days of December 31, 2021.Future\n transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limitedexceptions,\n such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share ofClass\n A common stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of the holders of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii)the date fixed\n by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date on which the shares of Class B common stock held by ourCo-Founders\n and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent less than 20% of the Class B common stock held by our Co-Founders and their permittedentities\n as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO, or (iii) nine months after the death or total disability of the last to die or becomedisabled of our Co-Founders, or such\n50\n", "later date not to exceed a total period of 18 months after such death or disability as may be approved by a majority of our independent directors.We cannot predict the impact our dual class struc\nture may have on our stock price.We\n cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity orother\n adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain oftheir\n indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capitalstructures\n to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make upthe\n S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structuresand\n temporarily  barred  new  multi-class  listings  from  certain  of  its  indices;  however,  in  October  2018,  MSCI  announced  its  decision  to  include  equity  securities  \u201cwithunequal\n voting structures\u201d in its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under the announced policies, our dualclass capital\n structure makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt topassively\n track  those indices  will not be investing  in our stock. These policies  are still  fairly  new and it is as of yet unclear  what effect,  if any, they will have on thevaluations\n of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companiesthat\n are included. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will nottake\n similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies  that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likelypreclude\n investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class Acommon stock could be adverse\nly affected.The trading price of our Class A common stock may be vola\ntile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.The\n trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond ourcontrol.\n These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price ofour Class A common stock include the \nfollowing:\u2022\nprice  and  volume  fluctuations  in  the  overall  stock  market  from  time  to  time,  including  fluctuations  due  to  general  economic  uncertainty  or  negative  marketsentiment, in particu\nlar related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\u2022\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks generally, or those in our industry, including fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate tothe operating perform\nance of those technology companies;\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\u2022\nsales or purchases of shares of our Class A common stock by us, our officers, or our significant stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales or purchasescould occur;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet theseestimates or the expe\nctations of investors;\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new offerings or platform features;\u2022\ninvestor sentiment and the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC, or those of our competitors or others inour industry;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\u2022\nshort selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative securities;\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\u2022\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\u2022\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies by us or our competitors;51\n", "\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or statements by public officials regarding potential newlaws or regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\u2022\nany significant change in our management or our board of directors; and\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.In\n addition,  in  the  past,  following  periods  of  volatility  in  the  overall  market  and  the  market  price  of  a  particular  company\u2019s  securities,  securities  class  actionlitigation\n has often been instituted against these companies. For example, as disclosed above, beginning in April 2019, several putative class actions have been filed inCalifornia\n state and federal courts and derivative actions have been filed in Delaware and California federal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, andcertain\n of  the  underwriters  named  in  our  IPO  Registration  Statement  alleging  violation  of  securities  laws,  breach  of  fiduciary  duties,  and  other  causes  of  action  inconnection\n with our IPO. Although we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them, such matters could result in substantialcosts and a diversion of our man\nagement\u2019s attention and resources.Sales\n of  substantial  amounts  of  our  Class  A  common  stock,  or  the  perception  that  such  sales  have  or  could  occur,  could  depress  the  market  price  of  our  Class  Acommon stock.\nThe\n market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market, and theperception\n that  these  sales  have  or  could  occur  may  also  depress  the  market  price  of  our  Class  A  common  stock,  including  if  there  is  short-selling  or  other  hedgingtransactions.\nWe have\n filed a registration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction ofapplicable\n exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be available for immediateresale in the United Stat\nes in the open market.Sales of our\n Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Thesesales could also cause the \ntrading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.Delaware\n law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxycontest difficult, thereby d\nepressing the market price of our Class A common stock.Our\n status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change incontrol\n by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which theperson\n became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate ofincorporation and amended \nand restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\u2022\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws require the approval of at least two-thirds of ourthen-outstanding voting power;\n\u2022\nour dual class common stock structure, which provides our Co-Founders, individually or together, with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of mattersrequiring\n stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B commonstock;\n\u2022\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\u2022\nour stockholders are only able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and are not able to take action by written consent for any matter;\u2022\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\u2022\nvacancies on our board of directors are able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\u2022\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President or a majority ofour board of directors;\n\u2022\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;52\n", "\u2022our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may beissued without further act\nion by our stockholders; and\u2022\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.These\n provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could alsodiscourage\n proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any ofwhich,\n under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could alsoaffect the price \nthat some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.Our amended and restate\nd bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between usand\n our stockholders and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising underthe Securities Act, each of which could limi\nt our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.Our amended and\n restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the soleand\n exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of ourdirectors,\n officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amendedand restated certificate of incorp\noration or our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall bethe\n Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all casessubject\n to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of theUnited States are the exc\nlusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.Any\n person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions.These exclusive-forum provisions\n may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or otheremployees,\n which  may  discourage  lawsuits  against  us  and  our  directors,  officers  and  other  employees.  If  a  court  were  to  find  the  exclusive-forum  provisions  in  ouramended\n and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions,which could harm our results of op\nerations.If\n securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market, or if they change theirrecommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversel\ny, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.The\n trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business,our\n market or our competitors.

If any of the analystswho\n cover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors orpublish\n inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these securities analysts cease coverage ofus\n or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price andtrading volume of our Class A common s\ntock to decline.We do not intend to pay dividends for the forese\neable future.We\n have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion ofour\n business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.

Thissection of\n this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of fiscal year 2019 and year-to-year\n comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults\n of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. This discussion contains forward-looking\n statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in thesection\n titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expectedfor any period in the future.\nFinancial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2021\n\u2022\nTotal revenue was $3.2 billion, an increase of 36% year-over-year.\u2022\nTotal  costs and expenses were $4.3 billion, including stock-based compensation expense of $724.6 million and insurance costs related to changes to insurancereserves attributab\nle to historical periods of $250.3 million.\u2022\nLoss from operations was $1.1 billion. \u2022\nOther income was $135.9 million, in cluding a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million as a result of the gain on the transaction with Woven Planet.\u2022\nNet loss was $1.0 billion, a decreas e of 42% and 61% compared to 2020 and 2019, respectively.\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA was $92.9 million, marking the Company \u2019s first annual Adjusted EBITDA profit.\u2022\nCash used in operating activi ties was $101.7 million.\u2022\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.Impact of COVID-19 to our Business\nThe\n ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  continues  to  impact  communities  in  the  United  States,  Canada  and  globally.  Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments\n and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions\n and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited\n the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform\n leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.\nAlthough\n we have seen some signs of demand improving as COVID-19 case counts trended down, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of thepandemic,\n demand levels continue to be affected by the impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. Theextent\n to  which  our  operations  will  continue  to  be  impacted  by  the  pandemic  will  depend  largely  on  future  developments,  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  beaccurately predicted,\n including new information which may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authoritiesand\n private businesses to contain the pandemic or recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has causedmany\n businesses to delay employees returning to the office. Even as travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders are modified or lifted, we anticipate that continued socialdistancing, altered consu\nmer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration ofthese challenges cannot b\ne presently estimated.In\n response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing\n and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcountreductions in 2020.\n56\n", "We have strengthened our business over the last year and we are confident in our ability to continue to navigate this challenging period. In 2021, we saw continuedrecovery\n as vaccines were more widely distributed and more communities fully reopened, which resulted in revenue increasing 36% in 2021 compared to the prior year,and\n the number of Active Riders increasing 49.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Net loss decreased $743.5 million, or 42%, from$1.8\n billion in 2020 to $1.0 billion in 2021, which included a benefit from a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million from the transaction with Woven Planet. Adjusted EBITDA in2021\n was  $92.9  million,  marking  our  first  annual  Adjusted  EBITDA  profitability.  We  remain  focused  on  our  long-term  growth  opportunities.  With  $2.3  billion  inunrestricted\n cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2021, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to continue business operations and totake\n action we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, stockholders, stakeholders and of drivers and riders on the Lyft Platform. For more information onrisks associated with the COVID-19 pandem\nic, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I.Recent Developments\nTransaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. \n(\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)On\n July 13, 2021, we completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assetsrelated\n to  our  self-driving  vehicle  division,  Level  5,  as  well  as  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyft  rideshare  and  fleet  data  to  accelerate  the  safety  andcommercialization of\n the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. We will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with thistransaction, with $165 mill\nion paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The\n divestiture  did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on our operations and financial  results, and therefore does not qualify for reporting as adiscontinued\n operation. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million as a result of our transaction with Woven Planet, which was included in other income, net on theconsolidated\n statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Refer to Note 4 \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial  statements for informationregarding the divestitu\nre of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.Reinsurance of Certain Legacy Auto Liabil\nity InsuranceOn\n April 22, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary,  Pacific  Valley Insurance  Company, Inc. (\u201cPVIC\u201d), entered  into a Quota Share Reinsurance  Agreement  (the\u201cReinsurance\n Agreement\u201d) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (\u201cDARAG\u201d), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, based on reserves inplace\n as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded toDARAG\n approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with anaggregate\n limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (\u201cthe Reinsurance Transaction\u201d). The Reinsurance Agreement arrangement does not discharge PVIC ofits\n obligations to the policyholder. A loss of approximately $20.4 million for the net cost of the Reinsurance Transaction was recognized on the consolidated statement ofoperations for the nine mon\nths ended September 30, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.Active Riders and Revenue per Active Rider\nThe\n COVID-19  pandemic  caused  a  significant  decrease  in  Active  Riders  and  in  revenue  per  Active  Rider  beginning  March  2020.  Though  we  experienced  arecovery in\n revenue per Active Rider and the number of Active Riders in 2021, the number of Active Rider levels have not reached levels we experienced prior to the onsetof\n the pandemic in March 2020. The number of Active Riders is a key indicator of the scale of our community and awareness of our brand. Revenue per Active Riderrepresents our ability \nto drive usage and monetization of our platform.Active Riders\n2021\n2020 2019 2020 to 2021 %Change\n2019 to 2020 %Change\n(in thousands, except for dollar amounts and percentages)\nThree Months Ended March 31\n13,494 21,211 20,503 (36.4)% 3.5% Three Months Ended June 30\n17,142 8,688 21,807 97.3% (60.2)% Three Months Ended September 30\n18,942 12,513 22,314 51.4% (43.9)% Three Months Ended December 31\n18,728 12,552 22,905 49.2% (45.2)% 57\n", "Revenue per Active Rider2021\n2020 2019 2020 to 2021 %Change\n2019 to 2020 %Change\nThree Months Ended March 31\n$45.13 $45.06 $37.86 0.2% 19.0% Three Months Ended June 30\n$44.63 $39.06 $39.77 14.3% (1.8)% Three Months Ended September 30\n$45.63 $39.94 $42.82 14.2% (6.7)% Three Months Ended December 31\n$51.79 $45.40 $44.40 14.1% 2.3% We define Active Riders as \nall riders who take at least one ride during a quarter where the Lyft Platform processes the transaction. An Active Rider is identified bya\n unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter,that person would count\n as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a singleActive Rider. If a ride has been requested by an\n organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Ridersunless the ride is access\nible in the Lyft App. Revenue per Active Rider is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by Active Riders for the same period.Beginning\n in the fourth quarter of 2020, some riders were able to access their Concierge rides in the Lyft App if they already had a Lyft account. Accordingly,Lyft\n updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider\u2019s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing the rider to accesstheir\n ride in the Lyft App. This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2020, allConcierge riders were exc\nluded from the calculation of Active Riders as Concierge rides could not be matched with verified rider accounts.With\n the exception of the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, Active Riders in each of the three monthperiods\n ended  June  30,  September  30,  and  December  31,  2021  increased  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020  as  vaccines  were  more  widely  distributed  and  morecommunities\n fully reopened. Active Riders in the three months periods ended June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2020 represented significantly lower Active Ridercounts\n since shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions were first implemented across North America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Theslight decrease in the number of Active Riders in the three months ended \nDecember 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was due primarilyto the increasing COVID-19 case counts \nfrom COVID-19 variants and their impact on demand as well as the seasonality we typically experience in the winter months.Revenue per Active Rider increased in each of the three months period\ns ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2021 as compared to the sameperiods\n in  2020,  primarily  reflecting  the  improvement  in  demand  on  our  platform  compared  to  earlier  periods  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  had  materiallylimited\n people's mobility and severely reduced Active Riders. Revenue per Active Rider reached an all-time high in the three months ended December 31, 2021, increasingcompared\n to the three months ended September 30, 2021. This was driven by an increase in ride frequency as well as a shift toward higher revenue rides such as airportrides,\n reflecting the increased travel experienced in the fourth quarter in 2021 nationwide. Revenue per Active Rider also benefited from revenues from licensing and dataaccess agreements, beg\ninning in the second quarter of 2021.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur\n consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  related  notes  thereto  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  are  prepared  in  accordance  withGAAP.\n The  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  also  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,revenue,\n costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonableunder\n the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, ourfuture financial st\natement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.We\n believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the mostcritical\n to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 of the notes to ourconsolidated financia\nl statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Revenue Recognition\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\nWe\n generate substantially all our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We recognize revenue from fees paid by drivers foruse\n of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Drivers enter into terms ofservice (\u201cToS\u201d) with us in orde\nr to use our Lyft Driver App.58\n", "We provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders. This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers tofind,\n receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a result, our singleperformance obligation in t\nhe transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders.We evaluate the presentation of revenue on\n a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to therider\n or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver to arider (the driver\u2019s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their promise to pro\nvide a transportation service to theircustomer\n through  use  of  the  Lyft  Platform.  While  we  facilitate  setting  the  price  for  transportation  services,  the  drivers  and  riders  have  the  discretion  in  accepting  thetransaction\n price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportationservices. As a result\n, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider.We\n report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from therider.\n We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with drivers toprovide\n transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not control theprovision of transportation s\nervices by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.We\n consider  the  ToS and our customary  business  practices  in identifying  the contracts  under  ASC 606. As our customary  business  practice,  a contract  existsbetween\n the driver and us when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related charges from riderson\n behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement todrivers; thus the driver\n\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.We earn\n service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the amountearned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charge\nd to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare arrangement, as we do notcontrol\n the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fullymitigated. We earn\n a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, in instances where an up-frontquoted fare offered to \na rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.We\n recognize  revenue  upon  completion  of  a  ride  as  the  single  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  and  we  have  the  right  to  receive  payment  for  the  servicesrendered upon the complet\nion of the ride.We\n offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if wecannot reasonably estim\nate the fair value of goods or services received.In\n some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations to requestrides\n for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or a percentage of theride price depending on the \ncontract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.We\n recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable subscription p\neriod.We\n generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling our promise to provide rideshare data and access toFlexdrive\n vehicles and bear the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. We act as a principal in delivering the data and accesslicenses and\n present revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery and vehicle access, are determined by assigning therelative fair\n value to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratably over the quarter for access to fleet vehicles asour\n respective  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  upon  the  delivery  of  each.  Refer  to  Note  4  \"Divestitures\"  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  informationregarding the divestitu\nre of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)\nWe\n generate  rental  revenues  primarily  from  Flexdrive,  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles,  and  Lyft  Rentals.  Under  the  Flexdrive  and  Lyft  Rentals  programs,  weoperate\n a fleet of rental vehicles comprised of both vehicles owned by us and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. We either lease or sublease vehicles todrivers\n and Lyft Rentals renters, as a result, we are considered the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Forvehicles\n that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements. Driverswho rent vehicles are cha\nrged rental fees, which we collect from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver\u2019s earnings on the Lyft Platform.59\n", "Revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicles riders are recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdriveand\n Lyft Rentals is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and LightVehicle transactions, we c\nlassify these rentals as operating leases.Insurance Reserves\nWe\n utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure orreinsure\n costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection understate\n law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have beenincurred but not yet\n reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined ona\n quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application ofloss\n development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness withclaims reserve valuations.\nInsurance\n claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we make certainassumptions\n based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significant  assumptions,  and  utilizeactuarial\n models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open,economic\n and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a ratethat differs from\n previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while webelieve\n that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As a result, the net amounts that willultimately\n be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets.We\n continue to review our insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and thelegal, regulatory and e\nconomic environment evolves.Stock-Based Compensation\nWe incur stock-based comp\nensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), stock options and stock purchase rights granted underour Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d).\nWe\n estimate  the fair  value  of stock options  granted  to employees,  directors  and consultants  and ESPP purchase  rights  using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricingmodel.\n The  fair  value  of  stock  options  that  are  expected  to  vest  is  recognized  as  compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period.  Werecognize compensation \nexpense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The\n fair  value  of  RSUs  and  PSUs  are  estimated  based  on  the  fair  market  value  of  our  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant,  which  subsequent  to  our  IPO  isdetermined based\n on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to our IPO, we granted RSUs which vest upon the satisfaction ofboth a service condition and \na performance condition.Compensation\n expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  theperformance\n condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.  The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of  our  IPORegistration\n Statement on March 28, 2019. On that date we recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the accelerated attributionmethod\n for the RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to theseRSUs\n is recorded over their remaining requisite service periods. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction of aservice-based\n condition only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. As of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation costrelated to RSUs was $587.5 million, which we expe\nct to recognize over the remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.Business Combinations\nWe account for our\n business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchaseconsideration\n to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value ofpurchase\n consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed, we make significant estimates and\n assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to bereasonable,\n but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceedone\n year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new informationis obtained related to \nfacts and60\n", "circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations.Acquisition costs, such as legal \nand consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.Goodwill\nGoodwill\n represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.Intangible\n assets resulting from the acquisition of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by us based on the fair value of assetsreceived. Intangible \nassets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.Goodwill\n is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate the carrying\n amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determinewhether\n further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than itscarrying amounts, the quant\nitative impairment test will be required. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \nNote 2 to  our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently issued accounting pronouncements notyet adopted as of the date o\nf this report. Components of Results of Operations\nAs noted above, we expect to see dec\nreased levels of demand for our platform, decreased numbers of new rider activations, and negative impacts on revenue for solong\n as  responsive  measures  to  COVID-19  remain  in  place  when  compared  to  levels  prior  to  the  onset  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  in  March  2020.  We  have  adoptedmultiple\n measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot be certain that these actions will mitigate some or all of the negative effects of the pandemic on ourbusiness.\n In light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financialand operating results in fu\nture periods.Revenue Recognition\nRevenue\n consists of revenue recognized from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings, Concierge platform fees from organizations that use ourConcierge\n offering, subscription fees paid by riders to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform, revenue from our vehicle service centers and revenue fromlicensing\n and data access agreements. Revenue derived from these offerings are recognized in accordance with ASC 606 as described in the Critical Accounting Policiesand Estimates above and in Note 2 o\nf the notes to our consolidated financial statements.Revenue also\n consists of rental revenues recognized through leases or subleases primarily from Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and our network of Light Vehicles, whichincludes revenue\n generated from single-use ride fees paid by riders of Light Vehicles. Revenue derived from these offerings are recognized in accordance with ASC 842 asdescribed in the Critic\nal Accounting Policies and Estimates above and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.We\n offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if wecannot reasonably estim\nate the fair value of goods or services received.Cost of Revenue\nCost\n of revenue consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through our multimodal platform which primarily includes insurance costs,payment\n processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing and bike and scooterrentals\n and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers in California. Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks and failed charges. Othercosts\n included  in  cost  of  revenue  are  hosting  and  platform-related  technology  costs,  vehicle  lease  expenses,  personnel-related  compensation  costs,  depreciation,amortization of te\nchnology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges and remarketing gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles.Operations and Support\nOperations\n and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email andchat\n support  to  users,  bike  and  scooter  fleet  operations  support  costs,  driver  background  checks  and  onboarding  costs,  fees  paid  to  third-parties  providing  operationssupport,\n facility costs and certain car rental fleet support costs. Bike and scooter fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance, and other customersupport activities re\nlated to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.Research and Development\n61\n", "Research  and  development  expenses  primarily  consist  of  personnel-related  compensation  costs  and  facilities  costs.  Such  expenses  include  costs  related  toautonomous vehicle technology \ninitiatives. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.On\n July 13, 2021, we completed a transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to ourself-driving\n vehicle division, Level 5, and as a result, certain costs related to our prior initiative to develop self-driving systems were eliminated beginning in the thirdquarter of 2021.\nSales and Marketing\nSales\n and marketing expenses primarily  consist of rider incentives, personnel-related  compensation costs, driver incentives for referring  new drivers or riders,advertising expenses, ride\nr refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.General and Administrative\nGeneral\n and  administrative  expenses  primarily  consist  of  personnel-related  compensation  costs,  professional  services  fees,  certain  insurance  costs  that  aregenerally\n not  required  under  TNC  regulations,  certain  loss  contingency  expenses  including  legal  accruals  and  settlements,  insurance  claims  administrative  fees,  policyspend, depreciation, fac\nility costs and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.Interest Expense\nInterest\n expense consists primarily of interest incurred on our 2025 Notes, as well as the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and debt discount.Interest expense also in\ncludes interest incurred on our Non-Revolving Loan and our Master Vehicle Loan.Other Income (Expense), Net\nOther income\n (expense), net consists primarily of a pre-tax gain as a result of the transaction with Woven Planet, interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents,sublease income and restricte\nd and unrestricted short-term investments.Provision for Income Taxes\nOur provision\n for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions and U.S. state income taxes. As we expand the scale of our internationalbusiness activities, any ch\nanges in the U.S. and foreign taxation of such activities may increase our overall provision for income taxes in the future.We\n have a valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. We expect to maintain thisvaluation allowance until\n it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized.62\n", "Results of OperationsThe following table summar\nizes our historical consolidated statements of operations data:Year Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020 2019 (in thousands)\nRevenue\n$ 3,208,323 $ 2,364,681 $ 3,615,960 Costs and expenses\nCost of revenue\n1,649,532 1,447,516 2,176,469 Operations and support\n402,233 453,963 636,116 Research and development\n911,946 909,126 1,505,640 Sales and marketing\n411,406 416,331 814,122 General and administrative\n915,638 946,127 1,186,093 Total costs and expenses\n4,290,755 4,173,063 6,318,440 Loss from operations\n(1,082,432) (1,808,382) (2,702,480) Interest expense\n(51,635) (32,678) \u2014 Other income, net\n135,933 43,669 102,595 Loss before income taxes\n(998,134) (1,797,391) (2,599,885) Provision for (benefit fro\nm) income taxes11,225 (44,534) 2,356 Net loss\n$ (1,009,359) $ (1,752,857) $ (2,602,241) The following table sets for\nth the components of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue:Year Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020 2019 Revenue\n100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Costs and expenses\nCost of revenue\n51.4 61.2 60.2 Operations and support\n12.5 19.2 17.6 Research and development\n28.4 38.4 41.6 Sales and marketing\n12.8 17.6 22.5 General and administrative\n28.5 40.0 32.8 Total costs and expenses\n133.7 176.5 174.7 Loss from operations\n(33.7) (76.5) (74.7) Interest expense\n(1.6) (1.4) \u2014 Other income, net\n4.2 1.8 2.8 Loss before income taxes\n(31.1) (76.0) (71.9) Provision for (benefit fro\nm) income taxes0.3 (1.9) 0.1 Net loss\n(31.5) % (74.1) % (72.0) % Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue \nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 to 2021 %Change\n2019 to 2020 %Change\n2021 2020 2019 (in thousands, except for percentages)\nRevenue\n$ 3,208,323 $ 2,364,681 $ 3,615,960 36 %(35) %Revenue\n increased $843.6 million, or 36%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the significant increase in the number of Active Riders in2021\n as compared to the prior year, as vaccines became more widely distributed and more communities reopened. Revenue in 2021 also benefited from revenues fromlicensing and data acc\ness agreements, beginning in the63\n", "second quarter of 2021. These increases were offset by investments in driver supply by increasing driver incentives recorded as a reduction to revenue by $942.9 million in2021 as compared to the prior y\near as rider demand outpaced driver supply during certain periods of the pandemic recovery in 2021. Revenue in 2020 was also higher in thefirst quarter of 2020 prio\nr to the implementation of shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions across North America beginning March 2020.We\n expect to see continued recovery in demand for our platform and the resulting positive impacts on revenue as there are more widespread immunity levels,more\n communities  reopen  and  other  restrictive  travel  and  social  distancing  measures  in  response  to  COVID-19  are  eased.

For more information regarding our use of these measuresand a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, see \u201cReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nContribution and Contribution Margin\nContribution\n and  Contribution  Margin  are  measures  used  by  our  management  to  understand  and  evaluate  our  operating  performance  and  trends.  We  believeContribution\n and Contribution Margin are key measures of our ability to achieve profitability and increase it over time. Contribution Margin has generally increased overthe periods presented as r\nevenue has increased at a faster rate than the costs included in the calculation of Contribution.We define Contribution as r\nevenue less cost of revenue, adjusted to exclude the following items from cost of revenue:\u2022\namortization of int angible assets;\u2022\nstock-based compensation exp ense;\u2022\npayroll tax expense rel ated to stock-based compensation;\u2022\nchanges to the liabilities f or insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods;\u2022\ntransaction costs related to  certain legacy auto insurance liabilities, if any; and\u2022\nrestructuring charges, if any.For more information about \ncost of revenue, see the section titled \u201cComponents of Results of Operations\u2014Cost of Revenue.\u201dContribution Margin is calcu\nlated by dividing Contribution for a period by revenue for the same period.We\n record  changes  to  historical  liabilities  for  insurance  required  by  regulatory  agencies  for  financial  reporting  purposes  in  the  quarter  of  positive  or  adversedevelopment\n even though such development may be related to claims that occurred in prior periods. For example, if in the first quarter of a given year, the cost of claimsgrew by $1 million\n for claims related to the prior fiscal year or earlier, the expense would be recorded for GAAP purposes within the first quarter instead of in the results ofthe\n prior period. We believe these prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations since these priorperiod\n changes relate to claims that could potentially date back years. We have limited ability to influence the ultimate development of historical claims. Accordingly,including\n the prior period changes would not illustrate the performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is run or managed by us. For consistency, we do notadjust\n the calculation of Contribution for any prior period based on any positive or adverse development that occurs subsequent to the quarter end. Annual Contribution iscalculated\n by adding Contribution of the last four quarters. We believe the adjustment to exclude changes to the historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatoryagencies\n from  Contribution  and  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  useful  to  investors  by  enabling  them  to  better  assess  our  operating  performance  in  the  context  of  current  periodresults.\nDuring the\n second quarter of 2021, we entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement for the reinsurance of legacy auto insurance liabilities between October1,\n 2018 to October 1, 2020, based on the reserves in place as of March 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2020, we entered into a Novation Agreement for the transfer ofcertain\n legacy  auto  insurance  liabilities  between  October  1,  2015  and  September  30,  2018.  Refer  to  Note  6  \u201cSupplemental  Financial  Statement  Information\u201d  to  theconsolidated\n financial  statements  for  information  regarding  these  transactions.  We  believe  the  costs  associated  with  these  transactions  related  to  certain  legacy  autoinsurance\n liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations despite this transaction occurring in the current period because the impactedinsurance liabilities relate\n to claims that date back years. We believe the adjustment to exclude these costs associated with transactions related to legacy insurance liabilitiesfrom\n Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current period results andprovide for better comp\narability with our historically disclosed Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA amounts.(1)(1)\n66\n", "Losses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement that exceed the combined funds withheld liability balance and collateralized amount established by DARAG forthe\n benefit  of  PVIC,  which  was  $346.5  million  at  the  execution  of  the  Reinsurance  Agreement,  but  are  below  the  aggregate  limit  of  $434.5  million  may  result  in  therecognition\n of a deferred gain liability. When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries are uncertain, the recovery method should be used. The deferred gainliability would\n be amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining settlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlementperiod\n of the ceded reserves will be based on the life-to-date  cumulative  losses collected  and will likely extend over periods longer than a quarter.  The amount of thedeferral\n will  be  recalculated  each  period  based  on  loss  payments  and  updated  estimates.  Consequently,  cumulative  adverse  development  for  claims  ceded  under  theReinsurance\n Agreement in subsequent periods may result in significant losses to the statement of operations unless the deferred gain amortization recognized in the sameperiod\n to offset said losses. We believe that the net amount recognized on the statement of operations associated with claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement,including\n any related adverse development and any benefit recognized for the related deferred gains, should be excluded to show the ultimate economic benefit of theReinsurance\n Agreement. This adjustment will help investors understand the economic benefit of our Reinsurance Agreement on future trends in our operations, as theyimprove\n over  the  settlement  period  of  any  deferred  gains.  Additionally,  net  amounts  recognized  for  claims  ceded  under  the  Reinsurance  Agreement  would  representchanges\n to historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies. As stated above, we believe prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate thecurrent\n period performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is managed. This is because we have limited ability to influence the ultimate development ofthese historical claims, which can potentially date\n back years. Therefore, in the event that the net amount of any adverse developments and any benefits from deferred gainsrelated\n to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement is recognized on the statement of operations in a subsequent period, those amounts will be excluded from thecalculation\n of Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA through the exclusion of changes to liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historicalperiods.\n As of December 31, 2021, there have been no such net amounts related to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement which have impacted our consolidatedstatement of operations.\nWe\n had  restructuring  efforts  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  2020  to  reduce  operating  expenses  and  adjust  cash  flows  in  light  of  the  ongoing  economicchallenges\n resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business. We believe the costs associated with the restructuring do not reflect current periodperformance\n of  our  ongoing  operations.  We  believe  the  adjustment  to  exclude  the  costs  related  to  restructuring  from  Contribution  and  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  useful  toinvestors\n by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current period results and provide for better comparability with our historicallydisclosed Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA amounts.\nFor\n more information regarding the limitations of Contribution and Contribution Margin and a reconciliation of revenue to Contribution, see the section titled\"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measu\nres\".Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are key\n performance measures that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operatingleverage\n in our business.  Because  Adjusted  EBITDA and Adjusted  EBITDA Margin facilitate  internal  comparisons  of our historical  operating  performance  on a moreconsistent basis, we use these m\neasures for business planning purposes. We expect Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin will increase over the long term as wecontinue to scale our business \nand achieve greater efficiencies in our operating expenses.We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as ne\nt loss, adjusted for:\u2022\ninterest expense; \u2022\nother income (expense), n et;\u2022\nprovision for (benefit f rom) income taxes;\u2022\ndepreciation and amortization; \u2022\nstock-based compensation exp ense;\u2022\npayroll tax expense rel ated to stock-based compensation;\u2022\nchanges to the liabilities f or insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods;\u2022\nsublease income; \u2022\ncosts related to acquis itions and divestitures, if any;\u2022\ntransaction costs related to  certain legacy auto insurance liability, if any; and\u2022\nrestructuring charges, if any.Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by d\nividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period.67\n", "During the third quarter of 2021, we entered into subleases for certain offices as part of the transaction with Woven Planet. Sublease income is included withinother\n income on our consolidated statement of operations, while the related lease expense is included within our operating expenses and loss from operations. Subleaseincome\n was immaterial prior to the third quarter of 2021. We believe the adjustment to include sublease income to Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enablingthem to better assess our op\nerating performance, including the benefits of recent transactions, by presenting sublease income as a contra-expense to the related lease chargeswithin our operating expenses.\nFor\n more information regarding the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, see thesection titled \u201cReconc\niliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.68\n", "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe\n use  Contribution,  Contribution  Margin,  Adjusted  EBITDA  and  Adjusted  EBITDA  Margin  in  conjunction  with  GAAP  measures  as  part  of  our  overallassessment of our perform\nance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, andto\n communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance.

This was offset by non-cashstock-based compensation exp\nense of $565.8 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $157.4 million.Investing Activities\nCash\n provided by investing activities was $267.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which primarily consisted of proceeds from sales and maturitiesof\n marketable securities of $3.8 billion and maturities of term deposits of $675.5 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $3.8 billion and termdeposits of $0.5 billion.\nCash\n provided by investing activities was $740.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of proceeds from sales and maturitiesof\n marketable securities of $5.4 billion and maturities of term deposits of $645.6 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $4.1 billion and termdeposits of $1.1 billion.\nFinancing Activities\nCash\n used in financing activities was $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which primarily consisted of repayment of loans of $44.4 million andprincipal payments on fin\nance lease obligations for $35.5 million.Cash provided\n by financing activities was $512.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of proceeds from issuance of our 2025Notes of $734.1 million offset by th\ne purchase of the Capped Calls for $132.7 million.Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs\n of  December  31,  2021,  our  principal  sources  of  liquidity  were  cash  and  cash  equivalents  of  approximately  $457.3  million  and  short-term  investments  ofapproximately $1.8 billion, exclusive of restricted\n cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of institutional money marketfunds,\n certificates  of  deposits,  commercial  paper  and  corporate  bonds  that  have  an  original  maturity  of  less  than  three  months  and  are  readily  convertible  into  knownamounts\n of cash. Also included in cash and cash equivalents are certain money market deposit accounts and cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debitcard\n transactions. Short-term investments consisted of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and term deposits, which mature in 12 months or less.Restricted\n cash, cash equivalents and investments consisted primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurancepurposes and amounts pledged to secu\nre certain letters of credit.We collect\n the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers at the time the ride is delivered using the rider\u2019s authorized payment method, and we retainany\n fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement to drivers. Accordingly, we maintain no accounts receivable from drivers. Our contracts with insuranceproviders\n require reinsurance premiums to be deposited into trust accounts with a third-party financial institution from which the insurance providers are reimbursed forclaims payments. Our rest\nricted reinsurance trust investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.We\n continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in March 2020, the pandemic and responses thereto contributed to a severedecrease\n in the number of rides on our platform and revenue which had a significant effect on our cash flows from operations. While conditions have improved, theseimpacts are ongoing. The ext\nent to which our operations,71\n", "financial results and financial condition will be impacted in the next few quarters by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertainand cannot\n be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, new information about additional variants, the availability and efficacy of vaccine distributions,additional\n or renewed actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or respond to its impact and altered consumer behavior, amongother\n things. We have adopted several measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing, and updating workplace\n policies. We also made adjustments to our expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenues including the transaction withWoven\n Planet  completed  on  July  13,  2021  and  headcount  reductions  in  2020.  Refer  to  Note  4  \"Divestitures\"  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  informationregarding the divestitu\nre of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.We cannot be\n certain that our actions will mitigate some or all of the continuing negative effects of the pandemic on our business. With $2.3 billion in unrestrictedcash\n and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  believe  we  have  sufficient  liquidity  to  meet  our  working  capital  and  capitalexpenditures needs for the n\next 12 months and beyond.Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, includin\ng, but not limited to our growth, our ability to maintain profitability on an Adjusted EBITDAbasis, our\n ability to attract and retain drivers and riders on our platform, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support ourefforts\n to develop our platform, actual insurance payments for which we have made reserves, measures we take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability tomaintain\n demand for and confidence in the safety of our platform during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. Asnoted\n above, we expect to see continued suppression of demand for our platform and the resultant negative impacts on revenue for so long as the travel restrictions andother\n social  distancing  measures  in  response  to  COVID-19  remain  in  place.  Further,  we  may  in  the  future  enter  into  arrangements  to  acquire  or  invest  in  businesses,products,\n services  and  technologies.  For  example,  we  intend  to  significantly  invest  further  into  EVs  in  order  to  achieve  compliance  with  the  California  Clean  MilesStandard\n and Incentive Program which sets the target that 90% of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. Our investment also allows us to makesteps\n toward our commitment to reach 100% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fundcapital\n expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations, or to refinance our existing or future indebtedness. In the event that we decide, or arerequired,\n to seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capitalwhen desired, our business, financi\nal condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summar\nizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):Payments Due by Period\nTotal\n12 months or less Thereafter Operating lease commitments\n$ 317.8 $ 67.6 $ 250.2 Financing lease commitments\n28.7 14.0 14.7 Long-term debt, including cu\nrrent maturities711.5 56.3 655.2 Other noncancelable agreements\n120.3 46.8 73.5 _______________\n(1)\nThe table excludes insurance reserves due to uncertainties in the timing of sett lement of these reserves.We\n did  not  have  during  the  periods  presented,  and  we  do  not  currently  have,  any  off-balance  sheet  financing  arrangements  or  any  relationships  withunconsolidated\n entities  or financial  partnerships,  including  entities  sometimes  referred  to as structured  finance  or special  purpose  entities,  that  were established  for  thepurpose of facilitating off-\nbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.(1)72\n", "Item 7A.

Basis for Opinions\nThe\n Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and forits\n assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearingunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is\n to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reportingbased\n on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to beindependent\n with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Securities  and  ExchangeCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe\n conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonableassurance\n about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control overfinancial reporting was mai\nntained in all material respects.Our\n audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financialstatements,\n whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regardingthe\n amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made bymanagement, as well as\n evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtainingan\n understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operatingeffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our au\ndits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Webelieve that our audits p\nrovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Repor\ntingA\n company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial\n statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reportingincludes\n those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositionsof\n the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withgenerally\n accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management anddirectors\n of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019sassets that could have\n a material effect on the financial statements.Because\n of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness\n to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with thepolicies or procedures m\nay deteriorate.75\n", "Critical Audit MattersThe\n critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor\n required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that  (i)  relate  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  (ii)involved\n our  especially  challenging,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments.  The  communication  of  critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  theconsolidated\n financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical auditmatters or on the accoun\nts or disclosures to which they relate.Valuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs\n described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial  statements, the Company utilizes a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance,which\n may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or reinsure costs, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage,first\n party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. As of December 31, 2021, insurancereserves\n totaled $1,069 million. Management makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factorsas\n one of the most significant assumptions and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis through ananalysis\n of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors among other inputs andassumptions.\nThe\n principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) thesignificant\n judgment by management when developing the estimated insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort inperforming\n procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves; (ii) the significant auditor effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence related to the actuarialvaluation methods and the loss d\nevelopment factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the\n matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves, including the controls over the development ofthe actuarial valuation methods\n and the loss development factors. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill andknowledge\n to  assist  in  developing  an  independent  estimate  of  the  insurance  reserves  for  certain  reserve  segments  and  comparison  of  this  independent  estimate  tomanagement\u2019s\n actuarially  determined  reserves.  Developing  the  independent  estimate  involved  testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  historical  data  provided  bymanagement, and independen\ntly developing loss development factors.Valuation of Certain Elements of the Transac\ntion with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)As\n described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of ToyotaMotor Corporation,\n for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Company\u2019s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilizationof\n Lyft rideshare and fleet data. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with this transaction, with $165 million paid upfrontand\n $350  million  to  be  paid  over  a  five-year  period.  As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  management  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangementconsideration\n was  attributable  to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  theutilization\n of Lyft rideshare and fleet data. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certainassets\n related  to  the  Level  5  division,  which  was  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  Level  5  division  assets,  valued  under  the  replacement  cost  method,  and  the  estimatedstandalone\n selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued using an adjusted market approach. The significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve used toestimate\n the fair value of the Level 5 division assets and the estimated miles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license used to determine the standaloneselling price of the r\nideshare data.The principal\n considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain elements of the transaction with Woven Planet isa\n critical  audit  matter  are  (i)  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment  and  subjectivity  in  performing  procedures  relating  to  the  fair  value  of  the  Level  5  division  assets  andestimated\n standalone selling price of the rideshare data due to the significant judgment by management when determining the values; (ii) the significant audit effort inevaluating\n management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve and the estimated miles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license; and(iii) the audit ef\nfort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.76\n", "Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the transaction with Woven Planet, including controls over the Company\u2019s valuationmethods,\n significant  assumptions  and  data.  These  procedures  also  included,  among  others  (i)  reading  the  transaction  agreement;  (ii)  testing  management\u2019s  process  fordeveloping\n the fair value estimate of the Level 5 division assets and estimating the standalone selling price of the rideshare data; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of thevaluation methods;\n (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the obsolescence curve and the estimated miles used torecreate\n the data produced from the rideshare license. Evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumption related to the obsolescence curve involvedconsidering\n the estimated life of comparable acquired technology. Evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumption related to the estimated milesused\n to  recreate  the  data  produced  from  the  rideshare  license  assumption  involved  considering  other  comparable  data  licensing  agreements  as  well  as  assessing  forconsistency\n with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\nOrganization and Description of Business\nLyft,\n Inc.  (the  \u201cCompany\u201d  or  \u201cLyft\u201d)  is  incorporated  in  Delaware  with  its  headquarters  in  San  Francisco,  California.  The  Company  operates  multimodaltransportation\n networks  in  the  United  States  and  Canada  that  offer  access  to  a  variety  of  transportation  options  through  the  Company\u2019s  platform  and  mobile-basedapplications.\n This network enables multiple modes of transportation including the facilitation of peer-to-peer ridesharing by connecting drivers who have a vehicle withriders\n who  need  a  ride.  The  Lyft  Platform  provides  a  marketplace  where  drivers  can  be  matched  with  riders  via  the  Lyft  App  where  the  Company  operates  as  atransportation network comp\nany (\u201cTNC\u201d).Transportation\n options through the Company\u2019s platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that connectsdrivers and riders in cities across the\n United States and in select cities in Canada, Lyft\u2019s network of Light Vehicles, the Express Drive program, where drivers can enter intoshort-term\n rental  agreements  with  Flexdrive  or  a  third  party  for  vehicles  that  may  be  used  to  provide  ridesharing  services  on  the  Lyft  Platform,  and  Lyft  Rentals,  aconsumer\n offering for users who want to rent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use, and Lyft Driver Centers and Lyft Auto Care, where drivers and riders canrequest auto maintenance an\nd collision repair services offered through the Lyft Platform in certain markets.Basis of Presentation\nThese\n consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) andinclude the accounts of th\ne Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.The\n Company  uses  the  U.S.  dollar  predominantly  as  the  functional  currency  of  its  foreign  subsidiaries.  For  foreign  subsidiaries  where  the  U.S.  dollar  is  thefunctional\n currency, gains and losses from remeasurement of foreign currency balances into U.S. dollars are included on the consolidated statements of operations. For theforeign\n subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments of foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded to aseparate component of a\nccumulated other comprehensive loss.Initial Public Offering\nThe\n Company\u2019s  registration  statement  on  Form  S-1  (the  \u201cIPO  Registration  Statement\u201d)  related  to  its  initial  public  offering  (\u201cIPO\u201d)  was  declared  effective  onMarch\n 28,  2019,  and  the  Company\u2019s  Class  A  common  stock  began  trading  on  the  Nasdaq  Global  Select  Market  on  March  29,  2019.  On  April  2,  2019,  the  Companycompleted\n its IPO, in which the Company sold 32,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $72.00 per share. On April 9, 2019, the Companysold\n an additional 2,996,845 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $72.00 per share pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchaseadditional\n shares. The Company received aggregate net proceeds of $2.5 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $70.3 million and offeringexpenses of $7.7 million subjec\nt to certain cost reimbursements.Immediately\n prior  to  the  completion  of  the  IPO,  219,175,709  shares  of  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  then  outstanding  converted  into  an  equivalentnumber\n of shares of common stock. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, whichauthorizes a total\n of 18,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 100,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, and 1,000,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Upon thefiling of\n the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 255,007,393 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock then outstanding were automatically reclassified intoan\n equivalent  number  of  shares  of  the  Company\u2019s  Class  A  common  stock.  Immediately  after  the  reclassification  and  prior  to  the  completion  of  the  IPO,  a  total  of12,779,709 shares of Class A\n common stock held by Logan Green, John Zimmer and their respective affiliated trusts were exchanged for an equivalent number of shares ofClass\n B common stock pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements. As a result, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has two classes of authorizedand outstanding common stock: Class A co\nmmon stock and Class B common stock.2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe\n preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts ofassets\n and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expensesduring\n the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience,expected\n future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that arenot readily apparent from \nother sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.85\n", "Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims, fair value of financial instruments, goodwilland\n identifiable  intangible  assets,  leases,  indirect  tax  obligations,  legal  contingencies,  valuation  allowance  for  deferred  income  taxes,  and  the  valuation  of  stock-basedcompensation.\nBeginning\n in the middle of March 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) in the United States, Canada, and globally has impacted the Company\u2019sbusiness.\n The Company continues to be impacted by COVID-19, but the long-term impact will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain andcannot\n be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, new information about additional variants, the availability and efficacy of vaccine distributions,additional\n or renewed actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or respond to its impact and altered consumer behavior, amongother\n things. The Company has adopted a number of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safetyrequirements\n for ridesharing and updating workplace policies. The Company also made adjustments to its expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenuesincluding\n headcount reductions in 2020. Refer to Note 17 \u201cRestructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the 2020 restructuring events. The\n Company  cannot  be  certain  that  these  actions  will  mitigate  the  negative  effects  of  the  pandemic  on  Lyft's  business.  As  of  the  date  of  issuance  of  the  financialstatements,\n the Company is not aware of any material event or circumstance that would require it to update its estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of theCompany's\n assets or liabilities, including the recording of any credit losses. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, andcould\n lead to impairment of long lived assets or goodwill, or credit losses associated with investments or other assets, and the impact of such changes on estimates will berecognized\n on  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  soon  as  they  become  known.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates  and  any  such  differences  may  bematerial to the Company'\ns financial statements.Segment Information\nOperating\n segments  are  defined  as  components  of  an  entity  for  which  separate  financial  information  is  available  and  that  is  regularly  reviewed  by  the  ChiefOperating\n Decision  Maker  (\u201cCODM\u201d)  in  deciding  how  to  allocate  resources  to  an  individual  segment  and  in  assessing  performance.  The  Company\u2019s  Chief  ExecutiveOfficer\n is  the  Company\u2019s  CODM.  The  CODM  reviews  financial  information  presented  on  a  consolidated  basis  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions,  allocatingresources,\n and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment. During the years ended December 31,2021,\n 2020 and 2019, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have materialassets located outside of \nthe United States.Revenue Recognition\nThe\n Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Lyft Platformand\n mobile-based applications. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated from its ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders and is recognizedin\n accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (\u201cASC 606\u201d). In addition, the Company generates revenue in accordance with ASC 606 from licensingand\n data access, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies. The Company also generates rental revenue from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles andLyft Rentals, which is recogniz\ned in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (\u201cASC 842\u201d).The table below presents the Comp\nany's revenues as included on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):Year Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020 2019 Revenue from contracts with \ncustomers (ASC 606)$ 2,957,979 $ 2,208,656 $ 3,465,473 Rental revenue (ASC 842)\n250,344 156,025 150,487 Total revenue\n$ 3,208,323 $ 2,364,681 $ 3,615,960 86\n", "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)The Company\n recognizes revenue for its rideshare marketplace in accordance with ASC 606. The Company generates revenue from service fees and commissions(collectively, \u201cfees\u201d) paid by\n drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully complete rides via the LyftApp\n where  the  Company  operates  as  a  TNC.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  upon  completion  of  each  ride.  Drivers  enter  into  terms  of  service  (\u201cToS\u201d)  with  theCompany\n in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platformand related\n activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver toprovide a\n transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the grossamount collected from the rider.\nAs\n the Company\u2019s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the ride lapses, whichtypically\n is upon pickup of the rider. The Company\u2019s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of asuccessful\n transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied upon the completion ofthe\n ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism andretains its fees befo\nre making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.The\n Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable\n subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from auto maintenance and collision repair services in accordance withASC 606.\nThe\n Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide ridesharedata\n and  access  to  Flexdrive  vehicles  and  bears  the  fulfillment  risk,  and  the  responsibility  of  providing  the  data,  over  the  license  period.  The  Company  is  acting  as  aprincipal\n in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery andvehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligation\ns. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratablyover the quarter for a\nccess to fleet vehicles as the Company\u2019s respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)\nThe\n Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Rental revenues are recognized for rental andrental related a\nctivities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842.The\n Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. TheCompany\n either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, asapplicable,\n in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs,as\n applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financialstatements. Drivers who rent v\nehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver\u2019s earnings on the LyftPlatform.\nDue\n to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenuegenerated\n from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals isrecognized evenly over th\ne rental period, which is typically seven days or less.Enterprise and Trade Receivables\nThe\n Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider\u2019s authorized payment method. Uncollected fees areincluded\n in  prepaid  expenses  and  other  current  assets  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  represent  receivables  from  (i)  participants  in  the  Company\u2019s  enterpriseprograms (\u201cEnterprise Users\u201d), where the transacti\nons have been completed and the amounts owed from the Enterprise Users have either been invoiced or are unbilled as ofthe reporting date; and (ii) riders where the authorized payment method is a credit card but the fare amounts have not yet settled wit\nh third-party payment processors. Underthe\n ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related chargesit\n collects from riders on behalf of drivers. Accordingly, the Company has no trade receivables from drivers. The portion of the fare receivable to be remitted to drivers isincluded in accrued and oth\ner current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.The\n Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected. As a result of the adoption ofAccounting\n Standards Update No. 2016-13 \u201cFinancial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses\" (\u201cASC 326\u201d), the Company\u2019s measurement of the allowance for credit losses has beenaugmented to reflect the chan\nge from the incurred loss87\n", "model to the expected credit loss model. The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company\u2019s current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the enterprise andtrade\n receivables  balance.  In  determining  the  expected  credit  losses,  the  Company  considers  its  historical  loss  experience,  the  aging  of  its  receivable  balance,  currenteconomic and\n business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodicallyand as needed, and amounts are wr\nitten off when determined to be uncollectible.The\n Company\u2019s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users, was $196.2 million, $104.7 million and $120.0 million as ofDecember\n 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company's allowance for credit losses was $9.3 million, $15.2 million and $6.2 million as of December 31, 2021,2020\n and 2019,  respectively.  The write-offs  were  immaterial  for  the  year  ended  December  31, 2021. The  change  in the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the  year  endedDecember\n 31, 2021 was related to $4.5 million of reductions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.4 million of write-offs. The change in the allowance for creditlosses for\n the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to $11.7 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $2.7 million of write-offs. The change inthe\n allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to $5.1 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.5 million ofwrite-offs.\nIncentive Programs\nThe\n Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive cashincentives\n while  riders,  Light  Vehicle  riders  and  Lyft  Rentals  renters  generally  receive  free  or  discounted  rides  under  such  incentive  programs.  Incentives  provided  todrivers,\n Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not theCompany\u2019s customers, incentiv\nes provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.Driver Incentives\nThe\n Company  offers  various  incentive  programs  to  drivers,  including  minimum  guaranteed  payments,  volume-based  discounts  and  performance-based  bonuspayments.\n These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.  TheCompany\n reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the mostlikely\n outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Companydoes\n not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives forreferring\n new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or theestablished fair value of t\nhe benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.Rideshare Rider Incentives\nThe\n Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentiveprograms are as follows:\n(i)\nMarket-wide marketing promotions.  Market-wide  promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.This\n type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by thedriver\n to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction torevenue at the date i\nt records the corresponding revenue transaction.(ii)\nTargeted marketing promotions.  Targeted  marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders. An example isa\n promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a limited period of timeto\n a targeted group of riders. The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides aresimilar\n to  marketing  coupons.  These  incentives  differ  from  the  market-wide  marketing  promotions  because  they  do  not  reduce  the  overall  pricing  of  theservice\n provided  by  drivers  for  a  specific  market.  During  the  promotion  period,  riders  not  utilizing  an  incentive  would  be  charged  the  full  fare.  Theseincentives\n represent marketing costs. When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of theincentive is recorded \nas sales and marketing expense.(iii)\nRider  referral programs. Under  the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee) completestheir\n first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the correspondingcharge\n recorded  to  sales  and  marketing  expense.  Referral  coupons typically  expire  within  one  year.  The  Company  estimates  breakage  using its  historicalexperience. As of December 31, 2021 \nand 2020, the rider referral coupon liability was not material.88\n", "Light Vehicle Rider and Lyft Rentals Renter IncentivesIncentives offered to L\night Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.For\n the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, in relation to the driver, rider, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters incentive programs, theCompany\n recorded $1.3 billion, $390.8 million and $560.3 million as a reduction to revenue and $64.7 million, $135.0 million and $381.5 million as sales and marketingexpense, respectively.\nRefunds\nFrom\n time  to  time  the  Company  issues  credits  or  refunds  to  riders  unsatisfied  by  the  level  of  service  provided  by  the  driver.  There  is  no  legal  obligation  toremunerate\n such riders nor does the Company issue such credits or refunds to riders on behalf of the drivers. The Company accounts for credits or refunds, which are notrecoverable\n from the drivers as sales and marketing expenses when incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, rider refunds were $19.1 million,$18.8\n million and $33.9 million, respectively. The Company accounts for credits and refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders as cost of revenue and was $6.5 million for theyear ended December 31, 2021. For the y\nears ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders were not material.Cost of Revenue\nCost\n of  revenue  consists  of  costs  directly  related  to  revenue  generating  transactions  through  the  Company\u2019s  multimodal  platform  which  primarily  includesinsurance\n costs, payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing andbike\n and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers. Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks and failed charges.Other\n costs  included  in  cost  of  revenue  are  hosting  and  platform-related  technology  costs,  vehicle  lease  expenses,  personnel-related  compensation  costs,  depreciation,amortization of technology-relate\nd intangible assets, asset write-off charges, and gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles.Operations and Support\nOperations\n and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email andchat support to\n users, bike and scooter fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, facility cost, certain car rental fleet support costs, andfees\n paid to third-parties providing operations support. Bike and scooter fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance, and other customer supportactivities related to repositioni\nng bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.Research and Development\nResearch\n and  development  expenses  primarily  consist  of  personnel-related  compensation  costs  and  facilities  costs.  Such  expenses  include  costs  related  to  theCompany\u2019s autonomous vehicle te\nchnology initiatives. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.Sales and Marketing\nSales\n and marketing expenses primarily  consist of rider incentives, personnel-related  compensation costs, driver incentives for referring  new drivers or riders,advertising\n expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $145.4million, $102.5 million and $188.3 m\nillion, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.General and Administrative\nGeneral\n and  administrative  expenses  primarily  consist  of  personnel-related  compensation  costs,  professional  services  fees,  certain  insurance  costs  that  aregenerally\n not  required  under  TNC  regulations,  certain  loss  contingency  expenses  including  legal  accruals  and  settlements,  insurance  claims  administrative  fees,  policyspend, depreciation, fac\nility costs, and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company incurs stock-based comp\nensation expense primarily from RSUs, PSUs, stock options, and ESPP purchase rights.The\n Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Schol\nes model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards. These variables include:\u2022\nper share fair value o f the underlying common stock;89\n", "\u2022exercise price; \u2022\nexpected term; \u2022\nrisk-free interest rate; \u2022\nexpected annual dividend yi eld; and\u2022\nexpected stock price volatilit y over the expected term.The\n Company estimates the expected term for stock options using the simplified method for \u201cplain vanilla\u201d stock option awards. The expected term of the ESPPpurchase\n rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period. Since the Company has limited history as apublic\n company and does not yet have sufficient trading history for the Company's common stock, the Company estimates volatility for stock options and ESPP purchaserights\n using the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly traded peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasuryzero-coupon issues simila\nr in duration to the expected term of the stock options or ESPP purchase rights granted.The\n fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line  basis over the requisite service period. TheCompany recognizes compensat\nion expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The fair value of RSUs and PS\nUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, which subsequent to the IPO isdetermined\n based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to the IPO, the Company granted RSUs which vestupon the satisfaction of both \na service condition and a performance condition.Compensation\n expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  theperformance\n condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.  The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of the  IPORegistration\n Statement on  March 28, 2019. On that date the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the acceleratedattribution method for \nthe RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relatedto these RSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service period\ns. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction ofa service-based condit\nion only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.Stock-based\n compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grantand revised, if necessar\ny, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.Income Taxes\nThe\n Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based onthe\n estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured usingthe enacted statutory tax rates that\n are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes the effect ondeferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Compa\nny records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets tothe net\n amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels ofincome, expectations and \nrisks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.Under the provisions\n of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law for all positions takenby\n the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may berecognized when it is more \nlikely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe\n technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expenseline in the accompanying \nconsolidated statement of operations.Business Combinations\nThe\n Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair valueof\n purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fairvalue\n of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired andliabilities\n assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are basedupon assumptions believed to be r\neasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result,90\n", "actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to theassets\n acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of theacquisition date.\n After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Acquisitioncosts, such as legal and consult\ning fees, are expensed as incurred.Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash\n equivalents consist of institutional money market funds and certificates of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars as well as commercial paper and corporatebonds. Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments having an original maturity\n of 90 days or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Alsoincluded\n in cash and cash equivalents are cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions, which was immaterial as of each of December 31,2021 and 2020, and money market deposit \naccounts that are stated at cost, which approximate fair value.Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted\n cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance purposesand amounts pledged\n to secure certain letters of credit.Investments\nDebt Securities\nThe Company\u2019s accounting for its investme\nnts in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company\u2019s intended holding period for the security,and\n the  nature  of  the  transaction.  Investments  in  debt  securities  include  commercial  paper,  certificates  of  deposit,  corporate  bonds  and  U.S.  government  securities.Investments in debt sec\nurities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.The\n Company  considers  an  available-for-sale  debt  security  to  be  impaired  if  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  is  less  than  its  amortized  cost  basis.  The  entiredifference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company\u2019s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the cons\nolidated statements of operationsas\n an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the securitybefore\n recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors. Inmaking\n this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security\u2019s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-partyrating\n agencies,  and  adverse  conditions  specific  to  the  security,  among  other  factors.  If  the  Company's  assessment  indicates  that  a  credit  loss  exists,  the  credit  loss  ismeasured\n based  on  the  Company's  best  estimate  of  the  cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected.  When  developing  its  estimate  of  cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected,  theCompany\n considers  all  available  information  relevant  to  the  collectability  of  the  security,  including  past  events,  current  conditions,  and  reasonable  and  supportableforecasts.\nCredit\n loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheetwith an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidate\nd statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an adjustment tothe\n amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. As of December 31, 2021, the Companyhad not recorded any credi\nt impairments. The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities on a specific identification method.The Company's investments in debt se\ncurities include:(i)\nCash  and  cash  equivalents. Cash  equivalents  include  certificates  of  deposits,  commercial  paper  and  corporate  bonds  that  have  an  originalmaturity of 90 days or less and \nare readily convertible to known amounts of cash.(ii)\nShort-term investments.  Short-term  investments are comprised of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which maturein twelve months or less. As a resul\nt, the Company classifies these investments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.(iii)\nRestricted investments. Restricted investments are comprised of debt security investments in commercial  paper, certificates of deposit, corporatebonds\n and U.S. government securities which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with insuranceproviders.\nNon-marketable Equity Securiti\nesThe\n Company has elected to measure its investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence ofobservable\n transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. The Company qualitatively assesses whether indicators of impairment exist.Factors\n considered in this assessment include the investees\u2019 financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, exposure to industries and markets impacted byCOVID-19, and the time\n91\n", "since  the  last  adjustment  to  fair  value,  among  others.  If  an  impairment  exists,  the  Company  estimates  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  by  using  the  best  informationavailable,\n which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair valueof the investment on the conso\nlidated statements of operations.Concentrations of Credit Risk\nThe\n Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cashwith multiple financi\nal institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cashequivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordin\ngly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities toinvestment-grade securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe\n Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of anasset\n or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants woulduse\n in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurringor\n nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fairvalue:\nLevel 1\nObservable inputs t hat reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2\nInputs  reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputsother\n than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data bycorrelation or other means.\nLevel\n 3Unobservable  inputs  reflecting  our  own  assumptions  incorporated  in  valuation  techniques  used  to  determine  fair  value.  These  assumptions  are  required  to  beconsistent with market \nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.The carrying\n values of the Company\u2019s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time topayment.\nLight Vehicle Fleet\nThe\n Company\u2019s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters. Scooters are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are included in prepaid expensesand\n other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the scooters, which isless than 12 months. As of December 3\n1, 2021, there were no scooters not yet placed in service. As of December 31, 2020, the cost of scooters not yet placed in service was$8.9\n million. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of scooters placed in service was $15.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of scooters placedin\n service was not material. Depreciation expense related to scooters was $5.9 million, $7.2 million and $35.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and2019, respectively. Bikes are \nincluded in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets.Leases\nThe\n Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach with an effective date as of the beginning of the fiscal year, January 1, 2019. TheCompany\n elected the package of transition provisions available for expired or existing contracts, which allowed the Company to carryforward the historical assessments of(1) whether\n contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is orcontains\n a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified  asset and whether the lessee has the right to control such asset. TheCompany\n determines the classification and measurement of its leases upon lease commencement. The Company enters into certain agreements as a lessor and either leasesor\n subleases the underlying asset in the agreement to customers. The Company also enters into certain agreements as a lessee. If any of the following criteria are met, theCompany classifies the\n lease as a financing lease (as a lessee) or as a direct financing or sales-type lease (both as a lessor):\u2022\nThe lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;\u2022\nThe lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;\u2022\nThe lease term is for 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, unless the commencement date falls within the last 25% of the economiclife of the underlying ass\net;\u2022\nThe present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying asset; or\u2022\nThe underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.92\n", "Leases that do not meet any of the above criteria are accounted for as operating leases.Lessor\nThe\n Company's lease arrangements include vehicle rentals to drivers or renters under the Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals programs and Light Vehicle rentals to single-use\n riders. Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate lease and non-leasecomponents,\n such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily fixed and are recognized asrevenue in the\n period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with eachlease\n revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration in its lease arrangements. The Company mitigatesresidual\n value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and through periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on theCompany's ongoing assessment of present \nand estimated future market conditions.Lessee\nThe\n Company's leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing services onthe\n Lyft Platform or renters for personal reasons through Lyft Rentals. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use assetand\n lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certainthat\n the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but has elected todo\n so for vehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements. For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to account for right-of-use assets and lease lia\nbilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.The\n Company\u2019s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the leasepayments\n based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the Companywould have to pay to borrow on a collat\neralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Compan\ny\u2019s lease liability calculation. Operating leases are included inoperating\n lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities \u2014 current and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease costs for the Company'soperating leases\n are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net,accrued and other current lia\nbilities, and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of theestimated useful\n lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. The interest component of finance leases is included incost of\n revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. Variable lease payments are recognizedprimarily in operat\ning expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.Property and Equipment\nProperty\n and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life ofthe\n related  asset,  which  is  generally  between two  and  seven  years.  Depreciation  for  property  and  equipment  commences  once  they  are  ready  for  our  intended  use.Maintenance\n and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the costand\n accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations in theperiod\n realized. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease, or the useful life of the assets. Construction inprogress is related to prop\nerty and equipment that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use.Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\n represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.Intangible\n assets resulting from the acquisition of entities are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting based on management\u2019s estimate of the fair value ofassets received. Intang\nible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two  to twelve years.Goodwill\n is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate\n the carrying value of the reporting unit may be in excess of its fair value. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company first performs a qualitativeassessment\n to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of theCompany\u2019s\n reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount,  the  quantitative  impairment  test  will  be  required.  Alternatively,  the  Company  may  bypass  the  qualitativeassessment and perform a qu\nantitative impairment test. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.93\n", "Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsThe\n Company  reviews  long-lived  assets,  including  property  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets,  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  businesscircumstances\n indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  the  assets  may  not  be  fully  recoverable.  Such  events  and  changes  may  include:  significant  changes  in  performancerelative\n to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company\u2019s business strategy. The Company measuresrecoverability\n of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If thecarrying value\n of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Therewas no impairment of long-l\nived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.Software Development Costs\nThe\n Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems. The Company capitalizes development costs related to the LyftPlatform\n and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used toperform\n the function intended. The Company capitalized $16.2 million and $12.8 million of software development costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 and2020, respectively. For the yea\nr ended December 31, 2019, capitalized software development costs was not material.Insurance Reserves\nThe\n Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, toinsure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underi\nnsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protectionunder\n state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that havebeen\n incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  estimable  administrative  run-out  expenses  related  to  the  processing  of  these  outstanding  claim  payments.  Liabilities  aredetermined\n on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information andapplication\n of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate t\nhe liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.Insurance\n claims  may  take  years  to  completely  settle,  and the  Company has limited  historical  loss  experience.  Because  of the  limited  operational  history,  theCompany\n makes  certain  assumptions  based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significantassumptions, and utilizes actuarial\n models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time theclaim\n remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in aprior\n year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.However,\n while the Company believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As aresult,\n the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for onthe\n consolidated balance sheets. The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additionalclaims are report\ned and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.Net Loss Per Share\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net\n loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities.The\n two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulatedand\n participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between commonstock\n and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company\u2019s redeemableconvertible\n preferred  stock  contractually  entitles  the  holders  of  such  shares  to  participate  in  dividends  but  does  not  contractually  require  the  holders  of  such  shares  toparticipate in the Comp\nany\u2019s losses. There were no redeemable convertible preferred shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.Basic net loss per share is co\nmputed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less sharessubject\n to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which theCompany reports\n net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to commonstockholders, because potent\nially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.94\n", "Recent Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted Accounting Pronoun\ncementsIn\n December  2019,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2019-12,  \"Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Simplifying  the  Accounting  for  Income  Taxes\",  which  removes  certainexceptions\n to the general principles in Topic 740 and improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amendingexisting\n guidance.

Acquisitions\nAcquisition of Flexdrive Services, LLC (\u201cFlexdr\nive\u201d)On\n February 7, 2020 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d), the Company completed its acquisition of Flexdrive for approximately $20.0 million and treated the acquisition as abusiness\n combination. The acquisition is expected to contribute to the growth of the Company's current business, and help expand the range of the Company's use cases.Prior\n to the acquisition, the Company acted as the lessee of Flexdrive\u2019s vehicles and sublessor for each vehicle prior to its rental by drivers. As of the Closing Date, theCompany\n had  approximately  $133.1  million  of  operating  lease  right-of-use  assets  and  $130.1  million  of  operating  lease  liabilities  on  the  balance  sheet  related  to  thispreexisting\n contractual relationship with Flexdrive. This preexisting contractual relationship and others were settled on the Closing Date as an adjustment to the purchaseprice, resulting in a to\ntal acquisition consideration paid of $13.0 million.95\n", "Acquisition costs were immaterial and are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.The following table summar\nizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Closing Date (in thousands):Cash and cash equivalents\n$ 587 Prepaid expenses and other cur\nrent assets276 Property and equipment\n111,881 Finance lease right-of\n-use assets56,014 Identifiable intangible assets\n - developed technology13,200 Total identifiable \nassets acquired181,958 Loans\n134,121 Finance lease & other liabilities\n57,265 Total liabilities assumed\n191,386 Net liabilities assumed\n(9,428) Goodwill\n22,455 Total acquisition conside\nration$ 13,027 Goodwill\n represents  the  excess  of  the  total  purchase  consideration  over  the  fair  value  of  the  underlying  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.

The acquisition is a taxable businesscombination for tax purposes \nand goodwill recognized in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.The\n fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $13.2 million with an estimated useful life of three years. The fair value of thedeveloped\n technology was determined using the avoided cost approach. In the avoided cost approach, the fair value of an asset is based on the future after-tax costs whichare\n avoided (or reduced) as a result of owning (or having the rights to) the asset for three years after the Closing Date.

Flexdrive's  results  of  operations  for  periods  prior  to  this  acquisition  were  not  material  to  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  and,accordingly, pro forma f\ninancial information has not been presented.Other Acquisitions\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, \nthe Company completed two business combinations which are not material to the consolidated financial statements.Pro\n forma  results  of  operations  have  not  been  presented  because  the  effects  of  the  acquisitions  were  not  material  to  the  Company\u2019s  consolidated  financialstatements.\n4. Divestitures\nTransaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. \n(\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)On July 13, 2021, the Company com\npleted a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certainassets\n related to the Company\u2019s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate thesafety and commerci\nalization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash inconnection with this transa\nction, with $165 million paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The\n divestiture  did  not  represent  a  strategic  shift  with  a  major  effect  on  the  Company\u2019s  operations  and  financial  results,  and  therefore,  does  not  qualify  forreporting\n as  a  discontinued  operation.  As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  the  Company  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangement  consideration  wasattributable\n to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyftrideshare\n and fleet data. The Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Level 5 division, which was based on therelative fair\n value of the Level 5 division, valued under the replacement cost method, and the estimated standalone selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued usingan\n adjusted market approach..

(\u201cPVIC\u201d),  entered  into  a  Quota  Share  ReinsuranceAgreement\n (the \u201cReinsurance Agreement\u201d) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (\u201cDARAG\u201d), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, basedon\n reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement,PVIC\n ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1,2020,\n with an aggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (\u201cthe Reinsurance Transaction\u201d). The Reinsurance Agreement is on a funds withheldbasis,\n meaning  that  funds  are  withheld  by  PVIC  from  the  insurance  premium  owed  to  DARAG  in  order  to  pay  future  reinsurance  claims  on  DARAG\u2019s  behalf.  Uponconsummation\n of the Reinsurance Transaction, a reinsurance recoverable of $251.3 million was established, and since a contractual right of offset exists, the reinsurancerecoverable\n has been netted against the funds withheld liability balance of $271.5 million for a $20.2 million net funds withheld liability balance included in accrued andother current liabilities on\n the consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the initial funds withheld balance of $271.5 million, additional coverage of certain legacy insuranceliabilities\n is collateralized by a trust account established by DARAG for the benefit of PVIC, which was $75.0 million upon consummation. As of December 31, 2021, thebalance\n of  the  net  funds  withheld  liability  is  zero.  A  loss  of  approximately  $20.4  million  for  the  total  cost  of  the  Reinsurance  Transaction  was  recognized  on  theconsolidated statemen\nt of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.The\n Reinsurance Transaction does not discharge PVIC of its obligations to the policyholder.

Commitments and Contingencies\nNoncancelable Purchase Commitments\nIn\n March 2018, the Company entered into a noncancelable arrangement with AWS, a web-hosting services provider, under which the Company had an obligationto\n purchase a minimum amount of services from this vendor through June 2021. In January 2019 and May 2020, the parties modified the aggregate commitment amountsand\n timing.  Under  the  amended  arrangement,  the  Company  committed  to  spend  an  aggregate  of  at  least  $300  million  between  January  2019  and  June  2022,  with  aminimum\n amount of $80 million in each of the three contractual periods, on services with AWS. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has made payments in excess of$300 million under the amend\ned arrangement.In\n November  2018,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  Motivate,  a  New  York  headquartered  bikeshare  company.  Over  the  approximately  five  yearsfollowing\n the  transaction,  the  Company  committed  to invest  an  aggregate  of  $100  million  in  the  bikeshare  program  for  the  New  York  metro  area.  The  Company  alsoassumed\n certain  pre-existing  contractual  obligations  to  increase  the  bike  fleets  in  other  locations  which  are  not  considered  to  be  material.  The  Company  has  madeinvestments totaling $87.1 m\nillion as of December 31, 2021.In\n May 2019, the Company entered into a noncancelable arrangement with the City of Chicago, with respect to the Divvy bike share program, under which theCompany\n has an obligation to pay approximately $7.5 million per year to the City of Chicago through January 2028 and to spend a minimum of $50 million on capitalequipment\n for  the  bike  share  program  through  January  2023.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had letters of credit outstanding of $53.1 million and $54.2million, respectively.\nIndemnification\nThe\n Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including certain business partners,investors,\n contractors, parties to certain acquisition or divestiture transactions and the Company\u2019s officers, directors and certain employees. The Company has agreed toindemnify\n and defend the indemnified party\u2019s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from actual or threatened third-party claimsbecause of the Company\u2019s act\nivities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible to determine themaximum\n potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  the  Company\u2019s  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  andcircumstances involved \nin each particular provision. To date, losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisionshave not been material.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is currently involved \nin, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations in theordinary\n course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, or third parties (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, various wage andexpense\n related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company\u2019s fees, rules or policies, that such fees, rules or policies violate applicablelaw,\n or  that  the  Company  has  not  acted  in  conformity  with  such  fees,  rules  or  policies,  as  well  as  proceedings  related  to  product  liability,  its  acquisitions,  securitiesissuances or business practices, or public di\nsclosures about the business. In addition, the Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigationmatters related \nto accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.The outcomes\n of the Company\u2019s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For some matters for which a material lossis\n reasonably  possible,  an  estimate  of  the  amount  of  loss  or  range  of  losses  is  not  possible  nor  is  the  Company  able  to  estimate  the  loss  or  range  of  losses  that  couldpotentially\n result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of theamount recorded.\nIndependent Contractor Classificat\nion MattersWith\n regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,administrative actions, government investigation\ns and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of thesedrivers\n as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws that would apply to driveremployees.\n Laws  and  regulations  that  govern  the  status  and  classification  of  independent  contractors  are  subject  to  change  and  divergent  interpretations  by  variousauthorities, which can cr\neate uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.For\n example,  Assembly  Bill  5  (as  codified  in  part  at  Cal.  Labor  Code  sec.  2750.3)  codified  and  extended  an  employment  classification  test  set  forth  by  theCalifornia Supreme Court that established a new\n standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill led to additional challenges tothe\n independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City Attorneys of LosAngeles,\n San  Diego  and  San  Francisco  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the  Company  and  Uber  for  allegedly  misclassifying  drivers  on  the  companies\u2019  respective  platforms  asindependent\n contractors  in  violation  of  Assembly  Bill  5  and  California\u2019s  Unfair  Competition  Law,  and  on  August  5,  2020,  the  California  Labor  Commissioner  filedlawsuits\n against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies\u2019 respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive reliefand\n material damages and penalties. On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers inCalifornia\n as employees until the end of the lawsuit. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework fordrivers\n utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020. OnApril\n 20, 2021, the court granted the parties\u2019 joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On May 3, 2021, the CaliforniaLabor\n Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber. The coordinationpetition\n was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On January 12, 2021, a separate lawsuit was filed in theCalifornia\n Supreme Court against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. The California Supreme Courtdenied\n review on February 3, 2021. Plaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 12, 2021. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services(PADS) -- the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that succes\nsfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 -- intervened in theAlameda\n lawsuit. On August 20, 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable. Both the CaliforniaAttorney General and\n PADS have filed appeals to the California Court of Appeal. Briefing is currently underway. Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts AttorneyGeneral filed a lawsuit \nagainst the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory andinjunctive relief.\n The Company and Uber filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court in March 2021. In September 2021, the Massachusetts Attorney Generalserved Lyft and Uber with a motion \nfor summary judgment on the issue of108\n", "driver classification. In January 2022, before Lyft and Uber served their opposition briefs, the court continued the summary judgment motion until at least June 2022 toallow\n the parties more time to conduct discovery. Certain adverse outcomes of such actions would have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial conditionand\n results  of  operations,  including  damages,  penalties  and  potential  suspension  of  operations  in  impacted  jurisdictions,  including  California  or  Massachusetts.  TheCompany\u2019s\n chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Such regulatory scrutiny or actionmay create different or conflicting\n obligations from one jurisdiction to another.The\n Company is currently  involved in a number of putative  class actions,  thousands of individual  claims,  including  those brought in arbitration  or compelledpursuant\n to the Company's Terms of Service to arbitration, matters brought, in whole or in part, as representative actions under California\u2019s Private Attorney General Act,Labor\n Code Section 2698, et seq., alleging that the Company misclassified drivers as independent contractors and other matters challenging the classification of drivers onthe\n Company\u2019s platform  as independent  contractors.  The Company is currently  defending  allegations  in a number of lawsuits  that  the Company has failed  to properlyclassify\n drivers and provide those drivers with sick leave and related benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are stilluncertain and any possible loss o\nr range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.The\n Company  disputes  any  allegations  of  wrongdoing  and  intends  to  continue  to  defend  itself  vigorously  in  these  matters.  However,  results  of  litigation,arbitration\n and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these driver claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materialimpact\n on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have an adverseimpact on the Company because o\nf defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.Unemployment Insurance Assessment\nThe\n Company is involved in administrative audits with various state employment agencies, including audits related to driver classification, in California, Oregon,Wisconsin,\n Illinois,  New  York,  New  Jersey  and  North  Carolina.  The  Company  believes  that  drivers  are  properly  classified  as  independent  contractors  and  plans  tovigorously\n contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain. The Company accrues liabilities that mayresult\n from assessments by, or any negotiated agreements with, these employment agencies when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, and the expense is recordedto general and administ\nrative expenses.Indirect Taxes\nThe\n Company is under audit by various domestic tax authorities with regard to indirect tax matters. The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily arises fromdisputes\n on  tax  treatment  and  tax  rates  applied  to  the  sale  of  the  Company\u2019s  services  in  these  jurisdictions.  The  Company  accrues  indirect  taxes  that  may  result  fromexaminations\n by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general andadministrative expenses.\nPatent Litigation\nThe\n Company is currently involved in legal proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course ofbusiness,\n the Company receives correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property and/or assertinginfringement\n of such property. The Company disputes any allegation of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters. The Company\u2019s chances ofsuccess on the merits ar\ne still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.Consumer and Other Class Actions\nThe Company is involved in a number of class actions alleging violati\nons of consumer protection laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, orTCPA,\n as well as violations of other laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, seeking injunctive or other relief. Recently, the Company received afavorable\n outcome in a case in the Northern District of California alleging ADA violations with respect to Lyft\u2019s wheelchair accessible vehicle offerings in three Bay Areacounties, \nIndependent  Living Resource Center San Francisco (\u201cILRC\u201d) v. Lyft, Inc. After  hearing evidence at a 5-day bench trial, the court ruled that plaintiffs failed theirburden\n to prove that Lyft violates the ADA. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling. Lyft is facing a similar ADA lawsuit in the Southern District of New York, Lowell v. Lyft,\n Inc.,  which  seeks  to  certify  New  York  and  nationwide  classes.  The  Company  disputes  any  allegations  of  wrongdoing  and  intends  to  continue  to  defend  itselfvigorously in these matte\nrs. The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.Personal Injury and Other Safety Mat\ntersIn\n the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business, various parties have from time to time claimed, and may claim in the future, that the Company is liable fordamages\n related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers, riders, or renters using or who have used services offered on the Lyft Platform, as well as from thirdparties.\n The Company is currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers on the Lyft Platform, other riders,renters and third part\nies. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses, disputes the allegations of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in109\n", "these matters. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in the Company\u2019s opinion, is likely tohave\n a  material  impact  on  its  business,  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations;  however,  results  of  litigation  and  claims  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  legalproceedings\n related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.For\n example, on January 17, 2020, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted the petition of multiple plaintiffs to coordinate their claims relating toalleged\n sexual  assault  or  harassment  by  drivers  on  the  Lyft  Platform,  and  a  Judicial  Council  Coordinated  Proceeding  has  been  created  before  the  Superior  Court  ofCalifornia, County of\n San Francisco, where the claims of these and other plaintiffs are currently pending. Regardless of the outcome of these or other matters, litigation canhave\n an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.Although\n the Company intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits, its chances of success on the merits are still uncertain as these matters are at various stages oflitigation\n and present  a wide range of potential  outcomes.  The Company accrues  for losses that may result  from these matters  when a loss is probable  and reasonablyestimable.\nSecurities Litigation\nBeginning\n in  April  2019,  multiple  putative  class  actions  and  derivative  actions  have  been  filed  in  state  and  federal  courts  against  the  Company,  its  directors,certain\n of its officers, and certain of the underwriters named in the IPO Registration Statement alleging violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and othercauses\n of action in connection with the IPO. The putative class actions have been consolidated into two putative class actions, one in California state court and the other infederal\n court. The derivative actions have also been consolidated into one action in federal court in California. On July 1, 2020, the California state court sustained in partand\n overruled in part the Company's demurrer to the consolidated complaint. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on August 3, 2020. On February26,\n 2021, the California state court struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend, and plaintiffs filed an amendedcomplaint\n on March 17, 2021. The Company filed its demurrer and motion to strike the amended claim on April 13, 2021, and on July 16, 2021, the California state courtoverruled the demurrer\n but struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend. The state court plaintiffs filed their renewedmotion\n to certify a class action on June 24, 2021, and on January 25, 2022, the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion without prejudice and stayed the case in light of the certifiedclass\n action proceeding in federal court. In the California federal court class action, on May 14, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaintand on September 8, 2020, the federal court granted in part an\nd denied in part that motion. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on October 2, 2020,and\n the court certified the class action on August 20, 2021, and set trial to commence on December 5, 2022. On February 8, 2022, the parties informed the court they hadreached\n an agreement in principle to settle the case on a class-wide basis. In the consolidated derivative action, at the parties\u2019 joint request, the California federal courtstayed\n the case on February 17, 2021. Although the Company believes these lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them, the Company hasaccrued amounts rela\nted to such matters when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general and administrative expenses.10.

The 2025 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Companywith\n interest payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2020, at a rate of 1.50% per year. The net proceedsfrom this offering were \napproximately $733.2 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers\u2019 discounts and commissions and debt issuance costs.The\n initial conversion rate for the 2025 Notes is 26.0491 shares of the Company's Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes, which isequivalent\n to  an  initial  conversion  price  of  approximately  $38.39  per  share  of  the  Class  A  common  stock.  The  initial  conversion  price  of  the  2025  Notes  represents  apremium of\n approximately 30% to the $29.53 per share closing price of the Company's Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2020. Theconversion rate is subjec\nt to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.The\n 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15,2025, only under the following circu\nmstances:\u2022\nduring any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, for at least 20trading days (whether or not cons\necutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediatelypreceding fiscal quar\nter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\u2022\nduring the five  business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d) in which the trading price (as defined in theIndenture)\n per  $1,000  principal  amount  of  2025  Notes  for  each  trading  day  of  the  measurement  period  was  less  than  98%  of  the  product  of  the  lastreported sale price o\nf the Company's Class A common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\u2022\nif the Company calls such Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding theredemption date; or\n\u2022\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events.On\n or after February 15, 2025, the 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holder until the close of business on the second scheduled trading dayimmediately prec\neding the maturity date.

Additionally in the event of a corporate event constituting a fundamentalchange\n (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 2025 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2025 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of theprincipal amount of the Not\nes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.In\n accounting for the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company separated the 2025 Notes into a liability and an equity component. At the date of issuance, theCompany\n determined the fair value of the liability component to be $558.3 million calculated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the borrowing rate fora\n similar nonconvertible debt instrument. The equity component representing the conversion option was $189.2 million and was determined by deducting the fair value ofthe\n liability  component  from  the  par  value  of  the  2025  Notes.  The  equity  component  is  not  remeasured  as  long  as  it  continues  to  meet  the  conditions  for  equityclassification.\n The  difference  between  the  principal  amount  of  the  2025  Notes  and  the  liability  component  (\"debt  discount\")  is  amortized  to  interest  expense  over  thecontractual term at an effective interest\n rate of 8.0%.111\n", "Debt issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes totaled $14.3 million and was comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the Initial Purchasers and third-party\n offering costs. The Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components of the 2025 Notes based on their relative values. Issuancecosts\n attributable to the liability component were $10.7 million and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term.Issuance costs attribut\nable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in stockholders\u2019 equity.The\n last reported sale price of the Company's Class A common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price of the 2025 Notes for at least 20 trading days duringthe\n 30 consecutive trading day period ended June 30, 2021.

The Company expects to recognize this expense over the remainingweighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years\n. The Company recognizes compensation expense on the RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of its IPO RegistrationStatement\n on March 28, 2019 using the accelerated attribution method. All RSUs granted after March 28, 2019 vest on the satisfaction of a service-based condition only.The Company recognizes compensa\ntion expense for such RSUs upon a straight-line basis over their requisite service periods.13.

The Company believes that, based on a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability ofthe deferred tax asse\nts such that a valuation allowance has been recorded. These factors include the Company\u2019s history of net losses since its inception.As of December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federa\nl and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7.5 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively.The\n federal net operating loss carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 expire at various dates beginning in 2030 and will continue to expire through2037,\n while federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 or later do not expire. The state net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire in 2022 and willcontinue\n to expire at various times depending upon individual state carryforward rules. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitationsdue to the ownership change lim\nitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state provisions.The\n Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. All net operating losses generated to date are subject to adjustment forU.S. federal and state incom\ne tax purposes. Additionally, all tax years remain open to examination as of December 31, 2021.The\n Company has not provided foreign  withholding  taxes  on the  undistributed  earnings  of its  foreign  subsidiaries  as of December  31, 2021, 2020, and 2019,because it intends to permanently reinvest such earning\ns outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability will beimmaterial, due to \nthe participation exemption put in place by the 2017 Tax Act.The\n Company\u2019s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interestand\n penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized any interest and penalties in itsconsolidated\n statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties. The Company has no material unrecognized tax benefits as ofDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n120\n", "14. Net Loss Per ShareBasic net loss per share is co\nmputed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less sharessubject\n to  repurchase.  The  diluted  net  loss  per  share  is  computed  by  giving  effect  to  all  potentially  dilutive  common  stock  equivalents  outstanding  for  the  period.  Forpurposes\n of this calculation, redeemable convertible preferred stock, stock options, RSUs, PSUs, the 2025 Notes, restricted stock awards, stock purchase rights grantedunder\n the Company\u2019s ESPP and early exercised stock options are considered to be common stock equivalents but are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss pershare when including them has an anti-diluti\nve effect. Basic and diluted net loss per share are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the sameliquidation and dividend righ\nts.The following table sets for\nth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data):Year Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020 2019 Net loss\n$ (1,009,359) $ (1,752,857) $ (2,602,241) Weighted-average sha\nres used in computing net loss per share, basic and diluted334,724 312,175 227,498 Net loss per share, basic and di\nluted$ (3.02) $ (5.61) $ (11.44) The following potentially\n dilutive outstanding shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because includingthem\n would have had an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied by the end of theperiod (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2021\n2020 2019 2025 Notes\n19,471 19,471 \u2014 Restricted stock units\n16,285 33,428 41,685 Stock options\n1,105 1,919 2,957 Performance based rest\nricted stock units831 175 \u2014 ESPP\n115 89 \u2014 Restricted stock awards\n\u2014 \u2014 94 Total\n37,807 55,082 44,736 _______________\n(1)\nIn  connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company entered into Capped Calls, which were not included for purposes of calculating the number of diluted shares outstanding, astheir\n effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Capped Calls are expected to reduce the potential dilution to the Company's common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2025 Notes issettled in\n cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2025 Notes the Company's common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2025Notes.\n15. Related Party Transactions\nDuring\n the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company purchased certain advertising-related and other services in the amount of $18.1 million from a companythat\n is affiliated with a significant stockholder of the Company, which was recorded to cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements ofoperations based on the natur\ne of the services. This entity ceased to be a related party in April 2019.During\n the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company purchased certain marketing services in the amount of $1.9 million from two companies owned by asignificant\n stockholder  of  the  Company.

RestructuringApril 2020 Restructuring Plan\nIn\n April  2020,  the  Company  announced  a  restructuring  plan  to  reduce  operating  expenses  and  adjust  cash  flows  in  light  of  the  ongoing  economic  challengesresulting\n from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Company\u2019s business. As a result of the restructuring plan, which was substantially completed in the secondquarter\n of  2020,  the  Company  recognized  a  stock-based  compensation  benefit  related  to  the  reversal  of  previously  recognized  stock-based  compensation  expenses  forunvested\n stock awards, primarily related to RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of its IPO Registration Statement on March 28, 2019 using the accelerated attributionmethod, of $72.7 million. This was offs\net by a $22.9 million charge related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards for employees who were terminated, resultingin\n a net stock-based compensation benefit of $49.8 million. Additionally, the Company recognized other restructuring charges including severance and other employeecosts\n of $32.1 million as well as lease termination and other restructuring charges of $3.1 million.

Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur\n management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controlsand\n procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the periodcovered by this\n Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December31, 2021, our disclosure controls and pro\ncedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Repor\ntingOur\n management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)under\n the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reportingand the preparation of conso\nlidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Our\n management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internalcontrol over financial reporting as\n of December 31, 2021 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations\n of  the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  ofDecember 31, 2021.\nThe\n effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independentregistered public ac\ncounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere\n were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management\u2019s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of theExchange\n Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financialreporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including\n our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internalcontrol over financial reporting will prevent all\n errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance\n that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be consider\ned relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance thatall control issues and inst\nances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and thatbreakdowns can occur because\n of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or morepeople or by management override of the\n controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,and\n there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequatebecause\n of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,misstatements due to e\nrror or fraud may occur and not be detected.Item 9B. Other Information.\nNone.\nItem 9C.

Employee acknowledges and agrees that the circumstances of Employee\u2019s separation of employment do not qualify Employee\nfor payments or benefits under the Severance Plan.\n6.\nNonadmission of Liability . Employee acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement, including the foregoing consideration, constitutes an admission of liability, express or implied, on the part of the Company with respect to any fact or matter which may be involved in\nEmployee\u2019s employment with or separation of employment from the Company. Employee further acknowledges that the Company denies that it or\nany of its employees, officers, directors, and/or agents ever acted toward Employee in a manner that would constitute a violation of any\nconstitutional, statutory or common law right, whether that right arises under state, federal or local law.\n7.\nGeneral Release and Covenant Not to Sue .

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Employee is not waiving, releasing or giving up any claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or unemployment benefits to which the Employee has an unwaivable right, vested pension or savings plan\nbenefits, claims to enforce this Agreement, claims under sections 2800 to 2810 of the California Labor Code, and claims under other state statutes\nthat may not be waived as a matter of law in an agreement of this type. Employee acknowledges, however, that Employee has no work-related injury\nor illness at the time of signing this Agreement for which Employee has not already filed a workers compensation claim. Nothing in any part of this\nAgreement limits or waives Employee\u2019s right to file a charge with an administrative agency, provide testimony or other information to an agency, or\ntake part in any agency investigation; however, Employee is waiving Employee\u2019s right to recover any monetary or other relief in connection with\nsuch an investigation or charge filed by Employee or by any other individual, or a charge filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\nor any other federal, state or local agency. If Employee is awarded money damages as described in the previous sentence, Employee shall decline to\naccept any such monetary award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and the limitation on monetary recovery does not limit Employee\u2019s\nright to receive any statutory or otherwise authorized award for information provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Employee does\nnot waive any rights or claims that arise after the effective date of this Agreement.\n3\n", "8.Adequate Consideration . Employee acknowledges that the consideration Employee is receiving under this Agreement, including but not limited to the Severance Pay, constitutes a benefit to which Employee is not otherwise entitled under any policy, statute, law, or any\nagreement between the Company and Employee, and is adequate consideration for Employee\u2019s covenants and obligations under this Agreement,\nincluding the General Release.\n9.\nNo Pending Litigation . Employee hereby represents that there is no pending action filed (either by Employee or on Employee\u2019s behalf) in any court of law, in arbitration, or in any other legal forum against the Company or any of the Released Parties or any other person, entity\nor corporation in connection with Employee\u2019s employment with the Company.\n10.\nProperty of Employer . Employee represents that Employee has returned to the Company all property of the Company, including but not limited to any keys, access cards, passwords, or equipment belonging to the Company and documents, records, and data in paper or electronic\nformat, as well as all copies of such materials.

Employee\nacknowledges and understands that such property, documents and materials are proprietary to the Company.

(a) \nConfidential or Proprietary Information. Employee acknowledges that, by reason of Employee\u2019s employment, Employee had access to confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information (including customer lists not known to the public) of the Company, and that Employee\nunderstands Employee\u2019s obligations under the law and agrees not to disclose or divulge to any third party or otherwise use or allow to be used in any\nmanner (whether for Employee\u2019s benefit, for the benefit of another individual or entity, or otherwise) any confidential, trade secret or proprietary\ninformation concerning the operations or business of the Company at any time following the Separation Date. These obligations shall not apply to\ninformation that (i) is now a part of public knowledge or literature or is generally known in the industry; or (ii) hereafter becomes a part of the public\nknowledge or generally known in the industry from a source other than Employee, either directly or indirectly. Moreover, nothing in this Agreement\nshall limit Employee\u2019s ability to report possible violations of law in confidence to the appropriate government agency or entity or make other\ndisclosures protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable federal or state law or regulation. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of\n2016, Employee will not face civil or criminal liability for disclosing a trade secret: (1) to a government official or an attorney, if the disclosure is\nmade in confidence and for the sole purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2) in a document filed in a lawsuit or other\nproceeding, provided the document is filed under seal. \nIn addition, if Employee files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, Employee may disclose a trade secret to Employee\u2019s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding,\nprovided the document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and Employee does not otherwise disclose the trade secret except pursuant to\ncourt order. \nThe confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations in this paragraph are in addition to, and not in lieu of, Employee\u2019s obligations under the Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement that Employee signed on October 6, 2014 (the \u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d),\nand Employee will remain bound by the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, at all times in the future, even after the Separation Date.\n(b) \nConfidentiality of Agreement. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the terms of this Agreement, to the extent they are not publiclydisclosed by the Company are \nABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL . To the fullest extent permitted by law, the terms of this Agreement, unless previously publicly disclosed by the Company \nshall not, without the Company\u2019s prior written consent, be disclosed 4\n", "to any person, firm, organization or entity, including but not limited to any current or former employees of the Company. Except as provided in thisparagraph, Employee shall not: (a) communicate or disclose in any way the amount of the Severance Pay or benefits made by the Company; or\n(b) give any indication of the amount of the Severance Pay. \nEmployee may communicate the terms and conditions of this Agreement (1) to Employee\u2019s spouse/domestic partner; or (2) to Employee\u2019s attorney and those rendering financial or legal advice and having a bona fide need to\nknow such terms and conditions; provided, however, Employee shall advise any such individuals beforehand of the existence of Employee\u2019s\nconfidentiality obligations under this Agreement and their corresponding obligations to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement. A breach of\nthese obligations by Employee\u2019s spouse/domestic partner, attorney, advisor, or agents will be deemed a breach of this Agreement by Employee.\nMoreover, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Employee from disclosing the terms and conditions of this Agreement to government agencies\nfor tax purposes (i.e., the IRS and Franchise Tax Board); or if required by a valid court order, subpoena, or regulatory request or other compulsory\nprocess or law; provided, however, that Employee shall advise such agency or court of the confidential nature of this Agreement and shall exercise\nreasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the subject matter disclosed. Further, the Company\nagrees that it will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to not publicly disclose any potential employment opportunity Employee may have\nprior to Employee or Employee\u2019s new employer/company announcing it, with the exception of required disclosures to the Company\u2019s Board of\nDirectors or advisors, or required by law, under applicable confidentiality obligations.\n(c) \nBreach of Confidentiality Provisions/Liquidated Damages. Employee agrees that if Employee, Employee\u2019s attorney, or Employee\u2019saccountant, financial advisor or spouse/domestic partner breaches the promise to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the Severance\nPay, then the resulting damage to the Company would be impracticable or extremely difficult to determine because of the uncertain effect of the\ndisclosure of such information on the Company\u2019s present and future business prospects. Because of the difficulty of determining the damages\nresulting from any such breach of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, the parties agree that in the event of such a breach by Employee\neither directly by Employee or indirectly through Employee\u2019s spouse, attorney or agents, Employee shall be obligated to re-pay to the Company the\nsum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) as liquidated damages for each occurrence, which amount Employee agrees is reasonable.

Employee\u2019s cooperation in\nconnection with such claims, actions, or investigations will include, but not be limited to, being available to meet with the Company\u2019s counsel to\nprepare for discovery or any legal proceeding, executing documents, and providing truthful testimony as a witness on behalf of the Company at\nmutually convenient times. The Company will reimburse Employee for all reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket costs and expenses (but not\nincluding attorneys\u2019 fees) that Employee incurs in connection with obligations under this paragraph.\n14.\nNon-Disparagement . The Parties agree that they will not disparage, discredit or otherwise defame one another, including the Company or its officers, directors and employees, in any form, manner, or media, including but not limited to oral or written statements, social\nmedia, or any other form of electronic communication, or otherwise take any action which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the\npersonal or business reputation of the Parties. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Parties from testifying truthfully in any valid judicial or\ngovernment agency proceeding.\n15.\nArbitration . To the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties agree to resolve any disputes that they may have with each other regarding the validity, interpretation, applicability, or effect of this Agreement or any alleged violations of it, through final, binding, and confidential\narbitration with JAMS, in accordance with JAMS employment law rules, available at \nhttps://www.jamsadr.com/rules- 5\n", "employment-arbitration/.

Each party shall bear its own attorneys fees and costs, unless otherwise required or allowed by law and awarded by the arbitrator, as\nprovided for below. Any arbitration may be initiated by a written demand to the other party identifying all claims forming the basis of the demand in\nsufficient detail to inform the other party of the substance of the claims. In no event shall the demand for arbitration be made after the date when\ninstitution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claims would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The arbitrator shall resolve\nall claims regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration.  The parties further agree that this Agreement is intended to be strictly\nconstrued to provide for arbitration as the sole and exclusive means for resolution of all disputes hereunder to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n The parties expressly waive any entitlement to have such controversies decided by a court or a jury and agree to bring any arbitration on an\nindividual basis only, and not on a class, collective, or representative basis. The party losing the arbitration shall reimburse the prevailing party for all\narbitration costs and expenses that the prevailing party paid pursuant to the provision of this paragraph, as well as reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\n16.\nOlder Workers\u2019 Benefit Protection Act .
