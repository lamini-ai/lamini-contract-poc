What comprises the Lyft transportation network?,"Our transportation network is comprised of:
• Ridesharing Marketplace. Our core offering since 2012 connects drivers with riders who need to get somewhere. The scale of our network enables us to predict demand and proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for drivers and offer convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada.
• Express Drive. Our flexible car rentals program for drivers who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our requirements. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform.
• Lyft Rentals. In 2019, we launched Lyft Rentals to offer an attractive option for users who have long-distance trips, such as a weekend away. This is a separate consumer offering from Express Drive.
• Light Vehicles. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for options that are more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. These modes can also help supplement the first-mile and last-mile of a multimodal trip with public transit.
• Public Transit. Available in select cities, our Transit offering integrates third-party public transit data into the Lyft App to offer users a robust view of transportation options around them and allows them to see transit routes to their destinations at no cost. Providing real-time public transit information is another step toward providing effective, equitable and sustainable transportation to our communities, and creating a more seamless and connected transportation network.
• Lyft Autonomous. We have a number of strategic partnerships that offer access to autonomous vehicles. Our Open Platform partnership with Motional (formerly Aptiv) has enabled the commercial deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles on our platform in Las Vegas. In July 2021, we completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate the safety and commercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. In December 2021, we launched an autonomous rideshare service in Miami with Ford and Argo AI, delivering on a shared commitment to deploy Ford’s autonomous vehicles, powered by the Argo Self-Driving System, on our ridesharing network.",Lyft - 7
What is Lyft's growth strategy?,"Our Growth Strategy
Transportation represents a massive market opportunity, one that we are in the very early stages of addressing. Our key growth strategies include our plans to:
• Increase Rider Use Cases. We are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offer products to simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services and university safe rides programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizations to manage the transportation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.
• Grow Active Riders. We see opportunities to continue to recoup and grow our rider base amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. We may make incremental investments in our brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We may also offer discounts for first-time riders to try Lyft or provide incentives to existing riders to encourage increased ride frequency. We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace by attracting and retaining more drivers on our network to deliver the best possible service levels. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand our network coverage beyond the geographies and markets we currently serve. We also believe we are a beneficiary of demographic shifts, such as the growing percentage of the U.S. population that is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.
• Grow Our Share of Consumers’ Transportation Spend. Lyft’s transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft network spans rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit and vehicle services. By integrating the fragmented transportation ecosystem, we are well positioned to deliver the best holistic experience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity.
• Deliver Increasing Value to Drivers. We strive to provide drivers that use Lyft with the best possible experience, including access to the best economic opportunities. For example, through our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We’ve also been investing in our Driver Centers, Mobile Services and related partnerships that offer drivers affordable and convenient vehicle maintenance services. By making the driver experience better and better, we can retain and attract more drivers to Lyft’s network.
• Invest in our Marketplace Technology. Our investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers and riders. Our investments in mapping, routing, payments, in-app navigation, matching technologies and data science are key to making our network more efficient and seamless to use.
• Thoughtfully Pursue M&A and Strategic Partnerships. In November 2018, we acquired Bikeshare Holdings LLC (“Motivate”), the largest bike sharing platform in the United States at the time and in February 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, LLC (“Flexdrive”), one of our longstanding Express Drive partners. We will continue to selectively consider acquisitions that contribute to the growth of our current business, help us expand into adjacent markets or add new capabilities to our network. We believe drivers and riders will continue to benefit from a broad partner ecosystem that builds on our existing loyalty and reward programs. We have also built strong relationships with transportation suppliers, state and local governments, and technology solutions providers and we intend to continue to pursue partnerships that contribute to our growth.",Lyft - 9
